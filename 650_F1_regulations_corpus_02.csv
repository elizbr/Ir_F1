a) The adjustable bodywork may only be activated by the driver in any of the pre-determined activation zones around each circuit. In conditions of poor visibility however the race director may, at his absolute discretion, disable all such systems until conditions improve.
If the adjustable bodywork is disabled in this way at any time during any of the three periods of the qualifying practice session (Q1, Q2 or Q3) it will remain disabled for the remainder of the relevant period.
b) For the sole purpose of improving overtaking opportunities during the race the adjustable bodywork may be activated by the driver after he has completed two laps after the race start or following a safety car period.
The driver may only activate the adjustable bodywork in the race when he has been notified via the control electronics (see Article 8.2 of the F1 Technical Regulations) that it is enabled. It will be enabled, and may only be used by the driver, if he is less than one second behind another at any of the pre-determined detection points around each circuit.
The system will be disabled by the control electronics the first time the driver uses the brakes after he has activated the system. In conditions of poor visibility, or if yellow flags are being shown in the activation zone, the race director may, at his absolute discretion, disable all such systems until conditions improve or yellow flags are withdrawn.
The FIA may, after consulting all competitors, adjust the above time proximity in order to ensure the stated purpose of the adjustable bodywork is met.

ii) Two sets of the mandatory race specification(s) may not be returned before the race. For the avoidance of doubt, if there are two mandatory race tyre specifications, one set of each specification may not be returned before the race.
From the seven remaining sets:
iii) Three sets must be electronically returned no later than two hours after the end of P1.
g) Once all tyres have been returned electronically after P1 and the qualifying practice session the Supplier will publish a list of the tyres which each driver has available to him for the remainder of the Event.
h) Prior to the start of the qualifying practice session intermediate and wet-weather tyres may only be used after the track has been declared wet by the race director, following
which intermediate, wet or dry-weather tyres may be used for the remainder of the session.
i) With the exception of any cars that are required to start the race from the pitlane, at the start of the race each car which qualified for Q3 must be fitted with the tyres with which the driver set his fastest time during Q2. This will only be necessary for these cars if dry- weather tyres were used to set the fastest time in Q2 and if dry-weather tyres are used at the start of the race.
Any such tyres damaged during Q2 will be inspected by the FIA technical delegate who will decide, at his absolute discretion, whether any may be replaced and, if so, which tyres they should be replaced with.
A penalty under Article 38.3(d) will be imposed on any driver whose car is not fitted with the tyres with which he set his fastest time in Q2 (except if damaged tyres have been replaced with the approval of the FIA technical delegate).
j) Unless he has used intermediate or wet-weather tyres during the race, each driver must use at least two different specifications of dry-weather tyres during the race, at least one of which must be a mandatory dry-weather race tyre specification as defined in Article 24.2(b). Unless a race is suspended and cannot be re-started, failure to comply with this requirement will result in the disqualification of the relevant driver from the race results.
If the race is suspended and cannot be re-started, thirty seconds will be added to the elapsed time of any driver who was unable to use at least two specifications of dry- weather tyre.
k) If the formation lap is started behind the safety car because of heavy rain (see Article 36.15(c)), or the race resumed in accordance with Article 42.5(a), the use of wet-weather tyres until the safety car returns to the pits is compulsory.
A penalty under Article 38.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who does not use wet weather tyres whilst the safety car is on the track at such times.
"
111,S,2020,supply_of_tyres_tyre_limitations_during_event,"24.5 Testing of tyres:
a) From the time at which each competitor receives fitted tyres from the Supplier at or before an Event these may not be used on any rig, simulator or vehicle, other than the F1 car for which they were intended.
b) Tyres supplied to any competitor at any time may not be used on any rig or vehicle (other than an F1 car on an F1 approved track, at the exclusion of any kind of road simulator), either Team owned or rented, providing measurements of forces and/or moments produced by a rotating full size F1 tyre, other than uniquely vertical forces, tyre rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag.
c) Tyres may be used on a test rig providing forces control and monitoring by F1 rim manufacturers for the sole purpose of proof testing their products."
112,S,2020,scrutinerring,"25.1 Each competitor will be required to carry out initial scrutineering of his cars and submit the duly
completed declaration no later than 18 hours before the start of P1.
The declaration form template may be found in the Appendix to these Sporting Regulations.
"
113,S,2020,scrutinerring,"25.2 Unless a waiver is granted by the stewards, competitors who do not keep to these time limits will not be allowed to take part in the Event.
"
114,S,2020,scrutinerring,"25.3 No car may take part in the Event until the declaration described in Article 25.1 above has been submitted, and the FIA technical delegate has confirmed to the competitor that he is satisfied it has been fully and correctly completed.
"
115,S,2020,scrutinerring,"25.4 Any competitor whose car has a change of survival cell after initial scrutineering (see Article 25.1 above) must complete a new declaration for approval by the FIA technical delegate. However, any such car may not be used until the following day.
"
116,S,2020,scrutinerring,"25.5 The scrutineers may:
a) Check the eligibility of a car or of a competitor at any time during an Event.

c) Require a competitor to pay the reasonable expenses which exercise of the powers mentioned in this Article may entail.
d) Require a competitor to supply them with such parts or samples as they may deem necessary.
"
117,S,2020,scrutinerring,"25.6 The race director or the clerk of the course may require that any car involved in an accident be stopped and checked.
"
118,S,2020,scrutinerring,"25.7 Checks and scrutineering shall be carried out by duly appointed officials who shall also be responsible for the operation of the parc fermé and who alone are authorised to give instructions to the competitors.
"
119,S,2020,scrutinerring,25.8 The stewards will publish the findings of the scrutineers each time cars are checked during the Event. These results will not include any specific figure except when a car is found to be in breach of the Technical Regulations.
120,S,2020,change_of_drivers,"26.1 a)
During a season each team will be permitted to use four drivers. Changes may be made at any time before the start of the qualifying practice session provided any change proposed less than 18 hours before the scheduled start of P1 receives the consent of the stewards.
Additional changes for reasons of force majeure will be considered separately.
Any new driver may score points in the Championship.
b) In addition to the above each team will be permitted to run additional drivers during P1 provided:
i) The stewards are informed which cars and drivers each team intends to use in each session no less than 18 hours before the scheduled start of P1, changes after this time may only be made with the consent of the stewards.
ii) No more than four drivers are used in any one session.
iii) They carry the race number that has been allocated to them.
iv) They use the engine and tyres which are allocated to the nominated driver.
v) They are in possession of a Super Licence or Free Practice Super Licence.
c) If one of the team’s nominated drivers is unable to drive at some stage after the end of initial scrutineering (18 hours before the scheduled start of P1), and the stewards consent to a change of driver, the replacement driver must use the engine, gearbox and tyres which were allocated to the original driver (see Articles 23.3, 23.5 and 24.4)."
121,S,2020,driving,"27.1 The driver must drive the car alone and unaided.
"
122,S,2020,driving,"27.2 Drivers must observe the provisions of the Code relating to driving behaviour on circuits at all times.
"
123,S,2020,driving,"27.3 Drivers must make every reasonable effort to use the track at all times and may not deliberately leave the track without a justifiable reason.
Drivers will be judged to have left the track if no part of the car remains in contact with it and, for the avoidance of doubt, any white lines defining the track edges are considered to be part of the track but the kerbs are not.
Should a car leave the track the driver may re-join, however, this may only be done when it is safe to do so and without gaining any lasting advantage. At the absolute discretion of the race director a driver may be given the opportunity to give back the whole of any advantage he gained by leaving the track.
"
124,S,2020,driving,"27.4 At no time may a car be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be deemed potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person."
125,S,2020,pit_entry_lane_exit,"28.1 The section of track between the first safety car line and the beginning of the pit lane will be
designated the “pit entry”.
"
126,S,2020,pit_entry_lane_exit,"28.2 The section of track between the end of the pit lane and the second safety car line will be designated the “pit exit”.
"
127,S,2020,pit_entry_lane_exit,"28.3 At no time may a car be reversed in the pit lane under its own power.
"
128,S,2020,pit_entry_lane_exit,"28.4 The pit lane will be divided into two lanes, the lane closest to the pit wall will be designated the ""fast lane"" and may be no more than 3.5 metres wide, the lane closest to the garages will be designated the ""inner lane"".
Other than when cars are at the end of the pit lane under Articles 36.2 and 41, the inner lane is the only area where any work can be carried out on a car. However, no work may be carried out in the fast lane if it is likely to hinder other cars attempting to leave the pit lane.
"
129,S,2020,pit_entry_lane_exit,"28.5 The FIA will allocate garages and an area in the pit lane on a strictly equal basis where each team may work and, within each of these designated garage areas, one position where pit stops during both practice and the race may be carried out.
"
130,S,2020,pit_entry_lane_exit,"28.6 No powered device may be used to lift any part of a car in the pit lane during a race.
"
131,S,2020,pit_entry_lane_exit,"28.7 Unless a car is pushed from the grid at any time during the start procedure, cars may only be
driven from the team’s designated garage area to the end of the pit lane.
Any car(s) driven to the end of the pit lane prior to the start or re-start of a practice session must form up in a line in the fast lane and leave in the order they got there unless another car is unduly delayed.
"
132,S,2020,pit_entry_lane_exit,"28.8 With the exception of the reconnaissance laps permitted by Article 36.1, any driver that is required to start the race from the pit lane may not drive his car from his team’s designated garage area until 30 minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap and must stop in a line in the fast lane.
Under these circumstances working in the fast lane will be permitted but any such work is restricted to:
a) Starting the engine and any directly associated preparation.
b) The fitting or removal of permitted cooling and heating devices.
c) Changes made for driver comfort.
d) Changing wheels and tyres.
When cars are permitted to leave the pit lane they must do so in the order that was established under Article 36.2 unless another car is unduly delayed. At all times drivers must follow the directions of the marshals.
"
133,S,2020,pit_entry_lane_exit,"28.9 Other than by drying or sweeping, or by laying tyre rubber when cars leave their pit stop position, competitors may not attempt to enhance the grip of the surface in the pit lane unless a problem has been clearly identified and a solution agreed to by the FIA safety delegate.
"
134,S,2020,pit_entry_lane_exit,"28.10 Competitors must not paint lines on any part of the pit lane.
"
135,S,2020,pit_entry_lane_exit,"28.11 Other than under 28.8 above no equipment may be left in the fast lane.
"
136,S,2020,pit_entry_lane_exit,"28.12 Team personnel are only allowed in the pit lane immediately before they are required to work on a car and must withdraw as soon as the work is complete.
All team personnel carrying out any work on a car in the pit lane when the car is in its pit stop position during the qualifying practice session, or during a race pit stop, must be wearing helmets which meet or exceed the requirements of ECE 22.05 - European motorcycle road helmet, DOT - USA motorcycle road helmet or JIS T8133-2015, class 2 – JPN protective helmets for motor vehicle users. The use of appropriate eye protection is compulsory.
"
137,S,2020,pit_entry_lane_exit,"28.13 a)
Cars must not be released from a garage or pit stop position in way that could endanger pit lane personnel or another driver.
Competitors must provide a means of clearly establishing, when being viewed from both above and in the front of the car, when a car was released.
b) If a car is deemed to have been released in an unsafe condition during any practice session, the stewards may drop the driver such number of grid positions as they consider appropriate.
c) If a car is deemed to have been released in an unsafe condition during a race a penalty under Article 38.3(d) will be imposed on the driver concerned. However, if the driver retires from the race as a result of the car being released in an unsafe condition a fine may be imposed upon the team.
d) An additional penalty will be imposed on any driver who, in the opinion of the stewards, continues to drive a car knowing it to have been released in an unsafe condition.
In all of the above cases, a car will be deemed to have been released either when it has been driven out of its designated garage area (when leaving from the garage) or after it has completely cleared its pit stop position following a pit stop.
"
138,S,2020,pit_entry_lane_exit,"28.14 Under exceptional circumstances the race director may ask for the pit entry to be closed during the race for safety reasons. At such times drivers may only enter the pit lane in order for essential and entirely evident repairs to be carried out to the car. A penalty under Article 38.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who, in the opinion of the stewards, entered the pit lane for any other reason whilst it was closed."
139,S,2020,weighing,"29.1 a)
After any free practice session or during the qualifying practice session cars will be weighed as follows:
i) When signalled to do so the driver will proceed directly to the FIA garage and stop his engine.
Any driver who fails to stop when asked to do so, and then fails to bring the car back to the FIA garage, or if work is carried out on the car before it is returned to the FIA garage, will be referred to the stewards.
ii) At the end of the qualifying session all cars which took part in Q3 will be weighed. If a driver wishes to leave his car before it is weighed, he must ask the technical delegate to weigh him in order that this weight may be added to that of the car.
iii) If a car stops on the circuit during the qualifying session and the driver leaves the car, he must go to the FIA garage immediately on his return to the pit lane in order for his weight to be established.
b) After the race any classified car may be weighed. If a driver wishes to leave his car before it is weighed, he must ask the technical delegate to weigh him in order that this weight may be added to that of the car.
c) The relevant car may be disqualified should its weight be less than that specified in Article 4.1 of the Technical Regulations when weighed under a) or b) above, save where the deficiency in weight results from the accidental loss of a component of the car.
d) No substance may be added to, placed on, or removed from a car after it has been selected for weighing or has finished the race or during the weighing procedure. (Except by a scrutineer when acting in his official capacity).
"
140,S,2020,weighing,29.2 In the event of any breach of these provisions for the weighing of cars the stewards may drop the driver such number of grid positions as they consider appropriate or disqualify him from the race.
141,S,2020,refuelling,"30.1 a)
b) Fuel may not be added to nor removed from a car after it has left the pit lane to start the
first reconnaissance lap permitted under Article 36.1.
c) Fuel may not be added to nor removed from a car during a race.
"
142,S,2020,refuelling,"30.2 No car may be refuelled, nor may fuel be removed from a car, at a rate greater than 0.8 litres per second.
"
143,S,2020,refuelling,"30.3 The driver may remain in his car throughout refuelling but the engine must be stopped.
"
144,S,2020,refuelling,"30.4 During all refuelling or fuel handling operations:
a) The relevant personnel must be wearing outer garments which are in compliance with either FIA Standard 8867-2016 or FIA Standard 8856-2000.

c) All cars, refuelling equipment and containers must be suitably grounded where necessary.
d) Any powered pumping system used to transfer fuel must be operated by a non-latching switch or be turned off automatically if the operator leaves.
"
145,S,2020,refuelling,"30.5 No car is permitted to consume more than 110kg of fuel, from the time at which the signal to start the race is given to the time each car crosses the Line after the end-of-race signal has been given. Other than in cases of force majeure (accepted as such by the stewards), any driver exceeding this limit will be disqualified from the race results.
"
146,S,2020,practice_sessions,"31.1 No driver may start in the race without taking part in at least one practice session.
"
147,S,2020,practice_sessions,"31.2 During all practices there will be a green and a red light at the end of the pit lane. Cars may only leave the pit lane when the green light is on. Additionally, a blue flag and/or a flashing blue light will be shown in the pit exit to warn drivers leaving the pit lane if cars are approaching on the track.
"
148,S,2020,practice_sessions,"31.3 Unless written permission has been given by the FIA to do otherwise, the circuit may only be used for purposes other than the Event after the last practice session on each day of practice and on the day of the race no less than one hour before the end of the pit lane is opened to allow cars to cover a reconnaissance lap.
"
149,S,2020,practice_sessions,"31.4 In the event of a driving infringement during any practice session the Stewards may delete a driver’s lap time (or lap times) or drop the driver such number of grid positions as they consider appropriate. Unless it is completely clear that a driver committed a driving infringement any such incident will normally be investigated after the relevant session.
Where appropriate, regard will also be given to the provisions of Article 18.1.
"
150,S,2020,practice_sessions,"31.5 Any driver taking part in any practice session who, in the opinion of the stewards, stops unnecessarily on the circuit or unnecessarily impedes another driver shall be subject to the penalties referred to in Article 31.4.
"
151,S,2020,practice_sessions,"31.6 Should it become necessary to stop any practice session because the circuit is blocked by an accident or because weather or other conditions make it dangerous to continue, the clerk of the course will order red flags to be shown at all marshal posts and the abort lights to be shown at the Line.
When the signal is given to stop all cars must immediately reduce speed and proceed slowly back to the pit lane. In order to ensure that drivers reduce speed sufficiently, from the time at which the “RED FLAG” message appears on the official messaging system until the time that each car crosses the first safety car line when entering the pit lane, drivers must stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU at least once in each marshalling sector (a marshalling sector is defined as the section of track between each of the FIA light panels).
All cars abandoned on the track will be removed to a safe place.
At the end of each practice session no driver may cross the Line more than once.
"
152,S,2020,practice_sessions,"31.7 The clerk of the course may interrupt practice as often and for as long as he thinks necessary to clear the track or to allow the recovery of a car. However, only during qualifying practice will the session be extended as a result.
Should one or more sessions be thus interrupted, no protest can be accepted as to the possible effects of the interruption on the qualification of drivers admitted to start.
"
153,S,2020,free_practice,"32.1 a)  One free practice sessions (P1), lasting one and a half hours 
will take place on the second day of the Event."
154,S,2020,qualifying_practice,"33.1 The qualifying practice session will take place on the day before the race and will start no less
than two and a half hours after the end of P1.
The session will be run as follows:
a) For the first eighteen minutes of the session (Q1) all cars will be permitted on the track and at the end of this period the slowest five cars will be prohibited from taking any further part in the session.
Lap times achieved by the fifteen remaining cars will then be deleted.
b) After a seven-minute break the session will resume for fifteen minutes (Q2) and the fifteen remaining cars will be permitted on the track. At the end of this period the slowest five cars will be prohibited from taking any further part in the session.
Lap times achieved by the ten remaining cars will then be deleted.
c) After an eight-minute break the session will resume for twelve minutes (Q3) and the ten remaining cars will be permitted on the track.
The above procedure is based upon 20 cars being officially eligible to take part in the Event. If 22 cars are eligible six will be eliminated after Q1 and Q2, if 24 cars are eligible seven cars will be eliminated after Q1 and Q2, and so on if more cars are eligible.
"
155,S,2020,qualifying_practice,"33.2 Any driver whose car stops on the circuit during the qualifying session will not be permitted to take any further part in the session.
"
156,S,2020,qualifying_practice,"33.3 At the end of qualifying practice the times achieved by each driver will be officially published.
"
157,S,2020,qualifying_practice,"33.4 An AOT, as defined in F1 Technical Regulations, must be empty during the complete qualifying
practice session."
158,S,2020,pre_race_parc_ferme,"34.1 Every team must provide the FIA technical delegate with a suspension set-up sheet for both of their cars before each of them leaves the pit lane for the first time during qualifying practice session.
"
159,S,2020,pre_race_parc_ferme,"34.2 Each car will be deemed to be in parc fermé from the time at which it leaves the pit lane for the first time during qualifying practice until the start of the race. Any car which fails to leave the pit lane during qualifying practice will be deemed to be in parc fermé at the end of Q1.
Between these times, other than when cars are sealed overnight in accordance with 34.4 below, the following work may be carried out:
a) Engines may be started.
b) Fuel may be added or removed and a fuel breather fitted.
c) Wheels, wheel fasteners and tyres may be removed, changed or rebalanced and tyre pressures checked.
d) Spark plugs may be removed in order to carry out an internal engine inspection and cylinder compression checks.
e) Permitted heating or cooling devices may be fitted.
f) A jump battery may be connected and on board electrical units may be freely accessed via a physical connection to the car.
g) Charging and / or discharging of the ERS energy storage devices.
h) The brake system may be bled.
i) Engine oil may be drained.
j) Compressed gases may be drained or added.
k) Fluids may be drained and/or replenished, however, fluids used for replenishment must conform to the same specification as the original fluid.
l) The aerodynamic set up of the front wing may be adjusted using the existing parts. No parts may be added, removed or replaced.
m) If the FIA technical delegate is satisfied that changes in climatic conditions necessitate alterations to the specification of a car, changes may be made to the air ducts around the front and rear brakes and radiator ducts. These changes may be made at any time after all teams have been sent the message “CHANGE IN CLIMATIC CONDITIONS” via the official messaging system. From this point onwards the choice of air ducts around the front and rear brakes and radiator ducts is free and pitot tubes may be covered or uncovered, subject always to compliance with the relevant Technical Regulations.
n) Bodywork (excluding radiators) may be removed and/or cleaned.
o) Cosmetic changes may be made to the bodywork and tape may be added.
p) Any part of the car may be cleaned.
q) On board cameras, marshalling system components, timing transponders and any associated equipment may be removed, refitted or checked.
r) Any work required by the FIA technical delegate.
s) Changes to improve the driver's comfort. In this context anything other than the adjustment of mirrors, seat belts and pedals may only be carried out with the specific permission of the FIA technical delegate.
Should ambient temperature change significantly, teams will be requested to change the head padding required by Article 14.6.1-6 of the Technical Regulations via the official messaging system.
The addition or removal of padding (or similar material) is also permitted but may only be carried out under supervision and, if required by the FIA technical delegate, must be removed before the post-race weighing procedure.
t) Drinking fluid for the driver may be added at any time, however, the capacity of the container for any such fluid must not exceed 1.5 litres.
u) Repair of genuine accident damage.
v) Any parts which are removed from the car in order to carry out any work specifically permitted above, or any parts removed to carry out essential safety checks, must remain close to it and, at all times, be visible to the scrutineer assigned to the relevant car.
Furthermore, any parts removed from the car in order to carry out any such work must be refitted before the car leaves the pit lane.
Any work not listed above may only be undertaken with the approval of the FIA technical delegate following a written request from the team concerned. It must be clear that any replacement part a team wishes to fit is the same in design and similar in mass, inertia and function to the original. Any parts removed will be retained by the FIA.
However, if a team wishes to change a part during the qualifying session, between reconnaissance laps and/or on the grid before the start of the race, this may be done without first seeking the permission of the technical delegate, provided it is reasonable for the relevant team to believe permission would be given if there was time to ask and the broken or damaged part remains in full view of the scrutineer assigned to the car at all times.
"
160,S,2020,pre_race_parc_ferme,"34.3 At the end of the qualifying practice at least six cars will be chosen at random to undergo further checks, once informed their car has been selected the team concerned must take the car to the parc fermé immediately.
"
161,S,2020,pre_race_parc_ferme,"34.4 Within three and a half hours of the end of the qualifying practice session all cars used during the session (or which were intended for use but failed to leave the pit lane) must be covered and ready for FIA seals to be applied in order to ensure that they remain secure until the following day. For marketing purposes this deadline may be extended for one car from each competitor for a maximum of two hours by prior arrangement with the FIA technical delegate.
However, no work of any kind may be carried out on the car any later than three and a half hours after the end of the qualifying practice session.
Whilst cars are covered overnight, they may be fitted with devices to keep them warm.
"
162,S,2020,pre_race_parc_ferme,"34.5 Five hours and 10 minutes before the start of the formation lap the seals and covers may be removed but the cars will remain under parc fermé conditions until the start of the race.
"
163,S,2020,pre_race_parc_ferme,"34.6 A competitor may not modify any part on the car or make changes to the set-up of the suspension whilst the car is being held under parc fermé conditions. In the case of a breach of
this Article the relevant driver must start the race from the pit lane and follow the procedures laid out in Article 36.2.
In order that the scrutineers may be completely satisfied that no alterations have been made to the suspension systems or aerodynamic configuration of the car (with the exception of the front wing) whilst in pre-race parc fermé, it must be clear from physical inspection that changes cannot be made without the use of tools.
"
164,S,2020,pre_race_parc_ferme,"34.7 One scrutineer will be allocated to each car for the purpose of ensuring that no unauthorised work is carried out whilst cars are being held under parc fermé conditions.
"
165,S,2020,pre_race_parc_ferme,"34.8 A list of parts replaced with the specific agreement of the FIA technical delegate whilst cars are being held under parc fermé conditions will be published and distributed to all teams prior to the race.
"
166,S,2020,pre_race_parc_ferme,"34.9 The mass of oil contained in each oil tank, with the exception of the main oil tank, must be declared to the FIA one hour before the start of the race."
167,S,2020,the_grid,"35.1 Unless the track was declared wet by the race director, any driver eliminated during Q1 whose best qualifying lap exceeds 107% of the fastest time set during that session, or who fails to set a time, will not be allowed to take part in the race. Under exceptional circumstances however, which may include setting a suitable lap time in the free practice session, the stewards may permit the car to start the race.
Any driver accepted in this manner will be placed at the back of the starting grid after any other penalties have been applied, and behind any driver penalised under Article 23.3(b).
Should there be more than one driver accepted in this manner they will be arranged on the grid in the order they were classified in P1.
"
168,S,2020,the_grid,"35.2 a) The grid will be drawn up as follows:
i) The last five positions will be occupied by the cars eliminated during Q1, the fastest
in 16th position.
ii) The next five positions will be occupied by the cars eliminated during Q2, the fastest in 11th position.
iii) The top ten positions will be occupied by the cars which took part in Q3, the fastest from the position on the grid which was the pole position in the previous year or, on a new circuit, has been designated as such by the FIA safety delegate.
If two or more drivers set identical times during Q1, Q2 or Q3 priority will be given to the one who set it first.
If more than 20 cars are entered in the Championship appropriate amendments will be made to the above in accordance with Article 33.1.
b) If more than one driver fails to set a time during Q2 or Q3 they will be arranged in the following order:
i) Any driver who attempted to set a qualifying time by starting a flying lap.
ii) Any driver who failed to start a flying lap.
iii) Any driver who failed to leave the pits during the period.
c) Once the grid has been established in accordance with a) and b) above, grid position penalties will be applied to the drivers in question in the order the offences were committed. If, following qualifying, more than one driver incurs a penalty under Article 23.3(e) or Article 23.5(a) preference will be given to the driver whose team first informed the technical delegate that a power unit or gearbox change will be carried out.
d) Any driver required to start the race from the back of the grid after incurring a penalty under Article 23.3(b) will be arranged on the grid behind any driver penalised under c) above.
If more than one driver is required to start the race from the back of the grid they will be arranged in qualifying order.
e) Any driver who incurs a penalty under Article 23.3(e) or Article 23.5(a) will take precedence over any driver whose qualifying times have been deleted for any reason.
If more than one driver falls into a single category in b) or e) above they will be arranged on the grid in the order they were classified in the previous period of qualifying or, in the case of Q1, the order they were classified in P1.
"
169,S,2020,the_grid,"35.3 The starting grid will be published no less than four hours before the start of the formation lap. Any competitor whose car(s) is (are) unable to start for any reason whatsoever (or who has good reason to believe that their car(s) will not be ready to start) must inform the stewards accordingly at the earliest opportunity and, in any event, no later than one hour and fifteen minutes before the start of the formation lap. If one or more cars are withdrawn the grid will be closed up accordingly. The final starting grid will be published one hour before the start of the formation lap.
"
170,S,2020,the_grid,35.4 The grid will be in a staggered 1 x 1 formation and the rows on the grid will be separated by 16 metres.
171,S,2020,starting_procedure,"36.1 40 minutes before the start of the formation lap the pit exit will be opened and all cars, including any that are required to start the race from the pit lane, will be permitted to leave the pit lane to cover a reconnaissance lap. Should any driver wish to cover more than one reconnaissance lap, this must be done by driving down the pit lane at greatly reduced speed between each of the laps. If a driver stops in his pit between reconnaissance laps the car may only re-join the track by being driven from the driver’s garage and not from his pit stop position.
At the end of these laps all cars starting the race from the grid should stop on the grid in starting order with their engines stopped.
All drivers going to the pit exit at this time must do so at a constant speed and with constant throttle. This applies over the whole of the pit lane whether a driver is going to the pit exit from his garage or travelling through the pit lane between reconnaissance laps.
Any car which does not complete a reconnaissance lap and reach the grid under its own power will not be permitted to start the race from the grid.
Once pit exit is opened, no more than forty two team personnel for each Competitor are permitted on the grid.
"
172,S,2020,starting_procedure,"36.2 32 minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap, a warning signal will be given indicating that the end of the pit lane will be closed in two minutes.
30 minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap the end of the pit lane will be closed and a second warning signal will be given. Any car which is still in the pit lane can start from the end of the pit lane provided it got there under its own power. If more than one car is affected they must line up in the order in which they qualified. However, any car reaching the end of the pit lane after the five minute signal must start behind any car already at the pit exit.
All such cars may then join the race once the whole field has passed the end of the pit lane for the first time after the start.
"
173,S,2020,starting_procedure,"36.3 The approach of the start will be announced by signals shown ten minutes, five minutes, three minutes, one-minute and fifteen seconds before the start of the formation lap, each of which will be accompanied by an audible warning.
When the ten minute signal is shown, everybody except drivers, officials and team technical staff must leave the grid.
"
174,S,2020,starting_procedure,"36.4 When the five minute signal is shown all cars on the grid must have their wheels fitted, after this signal wheels may only be removed in the pit lane and team personnel and equipment trolleys must commence leaving the grid.
A penalty under Article 38.3(d) will be imposed on any driver whose car did not have all its wheels fully fitted at the five minute signal.
"
175,S,2020,starting_procedure,"36.5 When the three minute signal is shown, no more than sixteen team personnel for each Competitor are permitted on the grid.
"
176,S,2020,starting_procedure,"36.6 When the one minute signal is shown, engines should be started and all remaining team personnel must leave the grid by the time the 15 second signal is given taking all equipment with them.
If any team personnel or team equipment remain on the grid after the 15 second signal has been shown the driver of the car concerned must start the race from the pit lane as specified in Article 36.2. A penalty under Article 38.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to start the race from the pit lane.
If any driver needs assistance after the 15 second signal he must raise his arm and, when the remainder of the cars able to do so have left the grid, marshals will be instructed to push the car into the pit lane.
In either of the above cases, marshals with yellow flags will stand beside any car (or cars) concerned to warn drivers behind.
"
177,S,2020,starting_procedure,"36.7 When the green lights are illuminated, all cars on the grid should begin the formation lap with the pole position driver leading.
When leaving the grid all drivers must respect the pit lane speed limit until they pass pole position.
Marshals will be instructed to push any car (or cars) which remain on the grid into the pit lane by the fastest route immediately after cars able to do so have left the grid. Any driver being pushed from the grid may not attempt to start the car and must follow the instructions of the marshals.
"
178,S,2020,starting_procedure,"36.8 During the formation lap practice starts are forbidden and the formation must be kept as tight as possible.
"
179,S,2020,starting_procedure,"36.9 Overtaking during the formation lap is only permitted if a car is delayed and cars behind cannot avoid passing it without unduly delaying the remainder of the field. In this case, drivers may only overtake to re-establish the original starting order. Any driver delayed in this way, and who is unable to re-establish the original starting order before he reaches the first safety car line, must enter the pit lane and start from the end of the pit lane as specified in Article 36.2.
A penalty under Article 38.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to enter the pit lane if he has not re-established the original starting order before he reaches the first safety car line.
"
180,S,2020,starting_procedure,"36.10 When the cars come back to the grid at the end of the formation lap (or laps, see Articles 36.15(c) and 42.5), they must stop within their respective starting grid positions, keeping their engines running.
There will be a standing start, the signal being given by means of lights activated by the permanent starter.
Once all the cars have come to a halt the five second light will appear followed by the four, three, two and one second lights. At any time after the one-second light appears, the race will be started by extinguishing all red lights.
"
181,S,2020,starting_procedure,"36.11 Unless specifically authorised by the FIA safety delegate, during the start of a race the pit wall must be kept free of all persons with the exception of the team personnel permitted under Article 22.13, officials and fire marshals.
"
182,S,2020,starting_procedure,"36.12 If, after returning to the starting grid at the end of the formation lap a problem arises, the following procedures shall apply:
a) If a car develops a problem that could endanger the start the driver must immediately raise his hands above his head and the marshal responsible for that row must immediately wave a yellow flag. If the race director decides the start should be aborted the green lights will be illuminated two seconds after the abort lights are switched on, a board saying “EXTRA FORMATION LAP” will be displayed and all teams will be informed via the official messaging system. All cars able to do so must complete a further formation lap whilst the car which developed the problem is moved into the pit lane.
When leaving the grid to complete the extra formation lap all drivers must respect the pit lane speed limit until they pass pole position.
The team may then attempt to rectify the problem and, if successful, the car may then start from the end of the pit lane. Should there be more than one car involved their starting order will be determined by the order in which they reached the end of the pit lane.
Every time this happens the race will be shortened by one lap.
b) If another problem arises which does not necessitate a delay to the start (see c) below), drivers will be asked to carry out an extra formation lap as set out in a) above. Any driver who caused the start to be aborted, and is then able to start the extra formation lap must enter the pit lane at the end of the lap and start the race as specified in Article 36.2. A penalty under Article 38.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to start the race from the pit lane.
c) If any other problem arises, and if the race director decides the start should be delayed, the following procedures shall apply:
i) If the race has not been started, the abort lights will be switched on, a board saying “DELAYED START” will be displayed, engines should be stopped and all teams will be informed of the likely delay via the official messaging system. Once the start time is known at least five minutes warning will be given.
Tyre changing on the grid is not permitted during such a delay.
Every time this happens the race will be shortened by one lap.
ii) If the race has been started the marshals alongside the grid will wave their yellow flags to inform the drivers that a car is stationary on the grid.
iii) If, after the start, a car is immobilised on the starting grid, it shall be the duty of the marshals to push it into the pit lane by the fastest route. Any driver being pushed from the grid may not attempt to start the car.
iv) Once the car is in the pit lane his mechanics may attempt to start it, if successful the driver may re-join the race. The driver and mechanics must follow the instructions of the track marshals at all times during such a procedure.
"
183,S,2020,starting_procedure,"36.13 Should Article 36.12 apply, the race will nevertheless count for the Championship no matter how often the procedure is repeated, or how much the race is shortened as a result.
"
184,S,2020,starting_procedure,"36.14 Any of the penalties under Articles 38.3 a), b), or c) will be imposed on any driver who is judged to have:
a) Moved before the start signal is given, such judgement being made by an FIA approved and supplied transponder fitted to each car, or;
b) Positioned his car on the starting grid in such a way that the transponder is unable to detect the moment at which the car first moved from its grid position after the start signal is given.
"
185,S,2020,starting_procedure,"36.15 Only in the following cases will any variation in the start procedure be allowed:
a) If it starts to rain after the seven minute signal but before the race is started and, in the opinion of the race director teams should be given the opportunity to change tyres, the abort lights will be shown on the Line and the starting procedure will begin again at the ten minute point.
b) If the start of the race is imminent and, in the opinion of the race director, the volume of water on the track is such that it cannot be negotiated safely even on wet-weather tyres, the abort lights will be shown on the Line and all teams will be informed of the likely delay via the official messaging system. Once the start time is known at least ten minutes warning will be given.
c) If track conditions are considered unsuitable to start the race at the scheduled time the start of the formation lap may take place behind the safety car. If this is the case, at the ten minute signal its orange lights will be illuminated, this being the signal to the drivers that the formation lap will be started behind the safety car. At the same time this will be confirmed to all teams via the official messaging system.
When the green lights are illuminated the safety car will leave the grid and all drivers must follow in grid order, no more than ten car lengths apart, and must respect the pit lane speed limit until they pass pole position. The safety car will continue until conditions are considered suitable for racing.
Any cars that were starting the race from the pit lane may join the formation lap once the whole field has passed the end of the pit lane for the first time. Any such cars may complete all formation laps but must enter the pit lane after the safety car returns to the pits and start the race from the end of the pit lane in the order they get there.
Any other car entering the pit lane during the formation laps may re-join the track but must enter the pit lane after the safety car returns to the pits and start the race from the end of the pit lane in the order they get there.
A penalty under Article 38.3(d) will be imposed on any driver whose tyre(s) are changed for a different specification before the start of the race.
Overtaking during the lap(s) behind the safety car is only permitted under the following circumstances:
i) If a car is delayed when leaving the grid and cars behind cannot avoid passing it without unduly delaying the remainder of the field, or
ii) If there is more than one car starting from the pit lane and one of them is unduly delayed.
In either case drivers may only overtake to re-establish the original starting order or the order the cars at the pit exit were in when the formation lap was started.
Any driver delayed in either way, and who is unable to re-establish the original starting order before he reaches the first safety car line on the lap the safety car returns to the pits, must enter the pit lane and may only join the race once the whole field has passed the end of the pit lane after the start of the race.
A penalty under Article 38.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to enter the pit lane if he has not re-established the original starting order before he reaches the first safety car line on the lap the safety car returns to the pits.
When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to call in the safety car a message “STANDING START” will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system, all FIA light
panels will display “SS” and the car's orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the teams and drivers that it will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap.
At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall more than ten car lengths behind it.
Once the safety car has entered the pit lane all cars, with the exception of those required to start from the pit lane, must return to the grid, take up their grid positions and follow the procedures set out in Article 36.10 to 36.14.
If, after several formation laps behind the safety car, track conditions are considered unsuitable to start the race from a standing start, the message “ROLLING START” will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will display “RS” and the car's orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the teams and drivers that it will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap.
At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall more than ten car lengths behind it.
As the safety car is approaching the pit entry the FIA light panels will be extinguished and replaced by waved green flags with green lights at the Line.
No driver may overtake another car on the track until he passes the Line (see Article 5.3) for the first time after the safety car has returned to the pits. The race will be deemed to have started when the leading car crosses the Line after the safety car has returned to the pits.
If, after several formation laps behind the safety car, track conditions are considered unsuitable to start the race, the message “START PROCEDURE SUSPENDED” will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system and all cars must enter the pit lane behind the safety car. The procedures described in Articles 41 and 42 must then be followed and there will be no standing start."
186,S,2020,the_race,"37.1 During the race, drivers leaving the pit lane may only do so when the light at the end of the pit lane is green and on their own responsibility. A marshal with a blue flag and/or a flashing blue light, will also warn the driver if cars are approaching on the track."

38.1 The race director may report any on-track incident or suspected breach of these Sporting Regulations or the Code (an “Incident”) to the stewards. After review it shall be at the discretion of the stewards to decide whether or not to proceed with an investigation.
The stewards may also investigate an Incident noted by themselves.
"
188,S,2020,incidents_during_race,"38.2 a)
It shall be at the discretion of the stewards to decide if any driver involved in an Incident should be penalised.
Unless it is clear to the stewards that a driver was wholly or predominantly to blame for an Incident no penalty will be imposed.
b) If an Incident is under investigation by the stewards a message informing all teams which driver or drivers are involved will be sent via the official messaging system.
Provided that such a message is displayed no later than 60 minutes after the race has finished the driver or drivers concerned may not leave the circuit without the consent of the stewards.
"
189,S,2020,incidents_during_race,"38.3 The stewards may impose any one of the penalties below on any driver involved in an Incident:
for at least five seconds and then re-join the race. The relevant driver may however elect not to stop, provided he carries out no further pit stop before the end of the race. In such cases five seconds will be added to the elapsed race time of the driver concerned.
b) A ten second time penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane, stop in his pit stop position for at least ten seconds and then re-join the race. The relevant driver may however elect not to stop, provided he carries out no further pit stop before the end of the race. In such cases ten seconds will be added to the elapsed race time of the driver concerned.
In both of the above cases the driver concerned must carry out the penalty the next time he enters the pit lane and, for the avoidance of doubt, this includes any stop the driver makes whilst a VSC or safety car procedure is in use.
c) A drive-through penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane and re-join the race without stopping.
d) A ten second stop-and-go time penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane, stop in his pit stop position for at least ten seconds and then re-join the race.
If any of the four penalties above are imposed upon a driver, and that driver is unable to serve the penalty due to retirement from the race, the stewards may impose a grid place penalty on the driver at his next Event.
If any of the four penalties above are imposed during the last three laps, or after the end of a race, Article 38.4(b) below will not apply and five seconds will be added to the elapsed race time of the driver concerned in the case of (a) above, 10 seconds in the case of (b), 20 seconds in the case of (c) and 30 seconds in the case of (d).
e) A time penalty.
f) A reprimand.
g) A drop of any number of grid positions at the driver’s next Event.
If any of the seven penalties above are imposed they shall not be subject to appeal.
h) Disqualification from the results.
i) Suspension from the driver’s next Event.
"
190,S,2020,incidents_during_race,"38.4 Should the stewards decide to impose either of the penalties under Article 38.3(a), (b), (c) or (d), the following procedure will be followed:
a) The stewards will give written notification of the penalty which has been imposed to the competitor concerned and will inform all teams via the official messaging system.
b) With the exception of Articles 38.3(a) and (b) above, from the time the team concerned is notified of the stewards’ decision via the official messaging system the relevant driver may cross the Line on the track no more than twice before entering the pit lane and, in the case of a penalty under Article 38.3(d), proceeding to his pit stop position where he shall remain for the period of the time penalty.
However, unless the driver was already in the pit entry for the purpose of serving his penalty, he may not carry out the penalty if the VSC procedure is in use or after the safety car has been deployed. The number of times the driver crosses the Line behind the safety car or during the VSC procedure will be added to the maximum number of times he may cross the Line on the track.
c) Whilst a car is stationary in the pit lane as a result of incurring a penalty under Articles 38.3(a) or (b) above it may not be worked on until the car has been stationary for the duration of the penalty.
d) Whilst a car is stationary in the pit lane as a result of incurring a time penalty under Article 38.3(d) above it may not be worked on. However, if the engine stops any work necessary
to re-start it may be carried out after the time penalty period has elapsed. If the team is unable to start the engine the car may then only be worked on in the driver’s garage.
e) Any breach or failure to comply with Articles 38.4 (b), (c) or (d) may result in the car being disqualified."
191,S,2020,safety_car,"39.1 The FIA safety car will be driven by an FIA appointed driver and will carry an FIA observer capable
of recognising all the competing cars who is in permanent radio contact with race control.
"
192,S,2020,safety_car,"39.2 Fifty minutes before the start of the formation lap the safety car will leave the pit lane and take up position at the front of the grid and remain there until the five minute signal is given. At this point (except under Article 36.15(c)) it will cover a whole lap of the circuit and take up position.
"
193,S,2020,safety_car,"39.3 The safety car may be brought into operation to neutralise a race upon the order of the clerk of the course.
It will be used only if competitors or officials are in immediate physical danger on or near the track but the circumstances are not such as to necessitate suspending the race.

194,S,2020,safety_car,"39.4 When the order is given to deploy the safety car the message ""SAFETY CAR DEPLOYED"" will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will display “SC” and all marshal's posts will display waved yellow flags and ""SC"" boards for the duration of the intervention.
"
195,S,2020,safety_car,"39.5 No car may be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be deemed potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person at any time whilst the safety car is deployed. This will apply whether any such car is being driven on the track, the pit entry or the pit lane.

"
197,S,2020,safety_car,"39.7 All competing cars must reduce speed and form up in line behind the safety car no more than ten car lengths apart. In order to ensure that drivers reduce speed sufficiently, from the time at which all teams have been sent the “SAFETY CAR DEPLOYED” message via the official messaging system until the time that each car crosses the first safety car line for the second time, drivers must stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU at least once in each marshalling sector and at both the first and second safety car lines (a marshalling sector is defined as the section of track between each of the FIA light panels).
The stewards may impose either of the penalties under Article 38.3a), b), c) or d) on any driver who fails to stay above the minimum time as required by the above.
"
198,S,2020,safety_car,"39.8 With the exception of the cases listed under a) to h) below, no driver may overtake another car on the track, including the safety car, until he passes the Line (see Article 5.3) for the first time after the safety car has returned to the pits.
The exceptions are:
a) If a driver is signalled to do so from the safety car.
b) Under 36.15(c) or 39.12 below.
c) When entering the pits a driver may pass another car remaining on the track, including the safety car, after he has reached the first safety car line.
d) When leaving the pits a driver may overtake, or be overtaken by, another car on the track before he reaches the second safety car line.
e) When the safety car is returning to the pits it may be overtaken by cars on the track once it has reached the first safety car line.
f) Whilst in the pit entry, pit lane or pit exit a driver may overtake another car which is also in one of these three areas.
g) Any car stopping in its designated garage area whilst the safety car is using the pit lane (see 39.11 below) may be overtaken.
h) If any car slows with an obvious problem.
"
199,S,2020,safety_car,"39.9 When ordered to do so by the clerk of the course the observer in the car will use a green light to signal to any cars between it and the race leader that they should pass. These cars will continue at reduced speed and without overtaking until they reach the line of cars behind the safety car.
"
200,S,2020,safety_car,"39.10 Except under 39.12 below, the safety car shall be used at least until the leader is behind it and all remaining cars are lined up behind him.
Once behind the safety car, the race leader must keep within ten car lengths of it (except under 39.13 below).
"
201,S,2020,safety_car,"39.11 Under certain circumstances the clerk of the course may ask the cars and the safety car to use the pit lane. In these cases, a signal to use the pit lane will be displayed before the start of the pit entry and all teams will be informed via the official messaging system, all cars must then enter the pit lane, drive through it and re-join the track. Any car entering the pit lane under these circumstances may however stop at its designated garage area. A penalty under Article 38.3(c) will be imposed on any driver who fails to enter the pit lane when required to do so.
Other than when the cars and the safety car are required to use the pit lane, no car may enter the pits whilst the safety car is deployed unless it is for the purpose of changing tyres.
"
202,S,2020,safety_car,"39.12 If the clerk of the course considers it safe to do so, and the message ""LAPPED CARS MAY NOW OVERTAKE"" has been sent to all teams via the official messaging system, any cars that have been lapped by the leader will be required to pass the cars on the lead lap and the safety car.
This will only apply to cars that were lapped at the time they crossed the Line at the end of the lap during which they crossed the first Safety Car line for the second time after the safety car was deployed.
Having overtaken the cars on the lead lap and the safety car these cars should then proceed around the track at an appropriate speed, without overtaking, and make every effort to take up position at the back of the line of cars behind the safety car. Whilst they are overtaking, and in order to ensure this may be carried out safely, the cars on the lead lap must always stay on the racing line unless deviating from it is unavoidable. Unless the clerk of the course considers the presence of the safety car is still necessary, once the last lapped car has passed the leader the safety car will return to the pits at the end of the following lap.
If the clerk of the course considers track conditions are unsuitable for overtaking the message ""OVERTAKING WILL NOT BE PERMITTED"" will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system.
"
203,S,2020,safety_car,"39.13 When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to call in the safety car the message ""SAFETY CAR IN THIS LAP"" will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system and the car's orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the teams and drivers that it will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap.
At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall more than ten car lengths behind it.
In order to avoid the likelihood of accidents before the safety car returns to the pits, from the point at which the lights on the car are turned out drivers must proceed at a pace which involves no erratic acceleration or braking nor any other manoeuvre which is likely to endanger other drivers or impede the restart.
As the safety car is approaching the pit entry the SC boards will be withdrawn and, other than on the last lap of the race, as the leader approaches the Line the yellow flags will be withdrawn and a green flag will be displayed at the Line.
"
204,S,2020,safety_car,"39.14 Each lap completed while the safety car is deployed will be counted as a race lap. However, if the procedure set out in Article 36.15(c) is followed Article 5.3(c) will apply.
"
205,S,2020,safety_car,"39.15 If the safety car is still deployed at the beginning of the last lap, or is deployed during the last lap, it will enter the pit lane at the end of the lap and the cars will take the end-of-race signal as normal without overtaking."

The first car to arrive in the pit lane should proceed directly to the pit exit staying in the fast lane, all the other cars should form up in a line behind the first car.
"
216,S,2020,suspending_a_race,"41.3 Any cars unable to return to the pit lane as a result of the track being blocked will be brought back when the track is cleared and will be arranged in the order they occupied before the race was suspended.
Additionally, any cars in the pit lane or pit entry at the time the race was suspended will be arranged in the order they occupied before the race was suspended. Any cars in their garage at the time the race was suspended will be arranged at the back of the line of cars in the fast lane in the order they got there. Any such cars will be permitted to leave the pit lane when the race is resumed but must re-enter the pit lane when the safety car returns and may join the race once the last car has passed the pit exit after the re-start (also see Article 42.8).
In all cases the order will be taken at the last point at which it was possible to determine the position of all cars. All such cars will then be permitted to resume the race.
The Safety Car will then be driven to the front of the line of cars in the fast lane.
"
217,S,2020,suspending_a_race,"41.4 Whilst the race is suspended:
a) Neither the race nor the timekeeping system will stop, however, in accordance with Article 5.3 the length of the race suspension will be added to the maximum two hour period.

"
221,S,2020,resuming_a_race,"42.3 When the five minute signal is shown all cars must have their wheels fitted, after this signal wheels may only be removed if the car has been moved out of the fast lane or during a further race suspension.
A penalty under Article 38.3(d) will be imposed on any driver whose car did not have all its wheels fully fitted at the five minute signal or has any of its wheels changed before it leaves the pit lane after the race has been resumed.
At the two minute point any cars between the safety car and the leader, in addition to any cars that had been lapped by the leader at the time the race was suspended, will be allowed to leave the pit lane and complete a further lap, without overtaking, and join the line of cars behind the safety car which left the pit lane when the race was resumed.
"
222,S,2020,resuming_a_race,"42.4 When the one minute signal is shown, engines should be started and all team personnel must leave the fast lane by the time the 15 second signal is given taking all equipment with them. If any driver needs assistance after the 15 second signal he must raise his arm and, when the remainder of the cars able to do so have left the pit lane, marshals will be instructed to push the car into the slow lane. In this case, marshals with yellow flags will stand beside any car (or cars) concerned to warn drivers behind. Drivers may leave the fast lane in order to pass any car unable to leave the pit lane.
"
223,S,2020,resuming_a_race,"42.5 The race will be resumed behind the safety car when the green lights are illuminated. The safety car will enter the pits after one lap unless:

a) Any driver who is delayed when leaving his position in the fast lane or during the lap(s) behind the safety car may overtake to re-establish his original starting position provided he does so before he crosses the first safety car line on the lap the safety car returns to the pits. Should he fail to do so he must re-enter the pit lane and may only re-join the race once the whole field has passed the end of the pit lane after the race has been resumed.
A penalty under Article 38.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to re-enter the pit lane if he has not re-established the original starting order before he reaches the first safety car line on the lap the safety car returns to the pits.
b) Drivers may leave the fast lane in order to overtake any car delayed when leaving its position in the fast lane.
Any driver whose car has been pushed from the fast lane, in accordance with Article 42.4 above, may not overtake in order to re-establish the order before the race was suspended.
"
225,S,2020,resuming_a_race,"42.7 Either of the penalties under Article 38.3(c) or (d) will be imposed on any driver who, in the opinion of the stewards, unnecessarily overtook another car during the lap (or laps).
"
226,S,2020,resuming_a_race,"42.8 When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to call in the safety car a message “STANDING START” will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will display
“SS” and the car's orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the teams and drivers that it will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap.
At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall more than ten car lengths behind it.
Once the safety car has entered the pit lane all cars, with the exception of those that were in their garage at the time the race was suspended (see Article 41.3), must return to the grid, take up their grid positions and follow the procedures set out in Article 36.10 to 36.14.

This will be the signal to the teams and drivers that it will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap.
At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall more than ten car lengths behind it.
As the safety car is approaching the pit entry the FIA light panels will be extinguished and replaced by waved green flags with green lights at the Line.
No driver may overtake another car on the track until he passes the Line (see Article 5.3) for the first time after the safety car has returned to the pits.
Each lap completed while the safety car is deployed will be counted as a race lap.
"
228,S,2020,resuming_a_race,"42.10 If, after several laps behind the safety car, track conditions are considered unsuitable to resume racing at all, the message “RE-START PROCEDURE SUSPENDED” will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system and all cars must enter the pit lane behind the safety car. The procedures set out in Article 41 and Articles 42.1-42.7 must then be followed and there will be no standing start.
"
229,S,2020,resuming_a_race,42.11 If the race cannot be resumed the results will be taken at the end of the penultimate lap before the lap during which the signal to suspend the race was given.
230,S,2020,finish,"43.1 A chequered flag will be the end-of-race signal and will be shown at the Line as soon as the
leading car has covered the full race distance in accordance with Article 5.3.
"
231,S,2020,finish,"43.2 Should for any reason the end-of-race signal be given before the leading car completes the scheduled number of laps, or the prescribed time has been completed, the race will be deemed to have finished when the leading car last crossed the Line before the signal was given.
Should the end-of- race signal be delayed for any reason, the race will be deemed to have finished when it should have finished.
"
232,S,2020,finish,"43.3 After receiving the end-of-race signal all cars must proceed on the circuit directly to the post- race parc fermé without any unnecessary delay, without receiving any object whatsoever and without any assistance (except that of the marshals if necessary).

272,S,2020,pu_supply_perimeter,"Preamble: The FIA and the Commercial Rights Holder remain entitled to decide jointly that this Appendix being withdrawn at any time if the number of Power Unit Manufacturers supplying power units in a Championship season is less than 3 (three).
a) As part of the homologation procedure of Appendix 4 of the Sporting Regulations, any Power Unit Manufacturer wishing to supply power units to a team must:
i) notify in writing the FIA of its intention to do so no later than 1 January (or such other date as agreed in writing between all of the Power Unit Manufacturers and the FIA) preceding the year during which such power units will be supplied;
ii) agree to be bound by the provisions of the Code, the Technical Regulations, the Sporting Regulations, the Judicial and Disciplinary Rules and all other relevant and applicable FIA rules and/or regulations (as supplemented or amended from time to time) and further to observe them; and
iii) agree to be subject to the jurisdiction of the internal judicial and disciplinary bodies of the FIA.
b) No power unit may be used in a given Championship season unless the Power Unit Manufacturer supplying such power unit accepts and adheres to the following conditions.
Each of the Power Unit Manufacturers of an homologated power unit must:
i) provide the FIA, before 15 May (or such other date as agreed in writing between all the Power Unit Manufacturers and the FIA) of the season preceding that in which such power units are to be supplied, with the list of teams (clearly identifying the appointed “works/factory” team, if any) to which a supply agreement has been concluded for the given Championship season ;
ii) if called upon to do so by the FIA before 1 June (or such other date as agreed in writing between all the Power Unit Manufacturers and the FIA) of the season preceding that in which such power units were to be supplied, supply at least a number of teams (“T”) equal to the following equation:
T = (11^1-A)/(B-C)
- A = Total number of teams (including “works/factory” teams) having a supply agreement concluded for the given Championship season with a New Power Unit Manufacturer.
- B = Total number of manufacturers of homologated Power Units for the given Championship season.
- C = Total number of New Power Unit Manufacturers for the given Championship season.
provided that if the result contains a fraction then the fraction shall count as a full team (e.g. 11 teams divided by 4 manufacturers = 2.75, each manufacturer must, if called upon to do so by the FIA, supply at least 3 teams).
In doing so, the FIA will first allocate the power unit supply between the Power Unit Manufacturers that are supplying the fewest number of teams, provided that the teams without a supply agreement shall be allocated to the Power Unit Manufacturer(s) that supplies(supply) the lowest number of teams and so on. If there is more than one Power Unit Manufacturer supplying the fewest number of teams (i.e. in the same position) and/or more than one team requesting a supply the allocation between such Power Unit Manufacturers shall occur by ballot (which ballot shall be transparent and undertaken by the FIA in the presence of a representative of each of the Power Unit Manufacturer(s) and the new Customer Team concerned).
Any such allocation made by the FIA will have to be formalised by a supply agreement with the concerned team by 1 August at the latest (or such other date as agreed in writing between all the Power Unit Manufacturers and the FIA).
A New Power Unit Manufacturer will not be required to comply with this obligation of supply as set out above.

In order to ensure that drivers reduce speed sufficiently, from the time at which the “RED FLAG” message appears on the official messaging system until the time that each car crosses the first safety car line when entering the pit lane, drivers must stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU at least once in each marshalling sector (a marshalling sector is defined as the section of track between each of the FIA light panels).
All cars abandoned on the track will be removed to a safe place.
At the end of each practice session no driver may cross the Line more than once.
"
101,S,2021,Practice Sessions,"4.4.7 The clerk of the course may interrupt practice as often and for as long as he thinks necessary to clear the track or to allow the recovery of a car. However, only during qualifying practice will the session be extended as a result.
Should one or more sessions be thus interrupted, no protest can be accepted as to the possible effects of the interruption on the qualification of drivers admitted to start.
"
102,S,2021,Free Practice,"
Two free practice sessions (P1 and P2), each lasting one and a half hours and separated by at least two hours, will take place on the first day of the Competition.
A further free practice session (P3), lasting one hour and starting no less than seventeen and a half hours after the end of P2, will take place the day before the race.
"
103,S,2021,Qualifying Practice,"
4.6.1 The qualifying practice session will take place on the day before the race and will start no less
than two hours after the end of P3. The session will be run as follows:
a. For the first eighteen minutes of the session (Q1) all cars will be permitted on the track and at the end of this period the slowest five cars will be prohibited from taking any further part in the session.
Lap times achieved by the fifteen remaining cars will then be deleted.
b. After a seven-minute break the session will resume for fifteen minutes (Q2) and the fifteen remaining cars will be permitted on the track. At the end of this period the slowest five cars will be prohibited from taking any further part in the session.
Lap times achieved by the ten remaining cars will then be deleted.
c. After an eight-minute break the session will resume for twelve minutes (Q3) and the ten remaining cars will be permitted on the track.
The above procedure is based upon 20 cars being officially eligible to take part in the Competition. If 22 cars are eligible six will be eliminated after Q1 and Q2, if 24 cars are eligible seven cars will be eliminated after Q1 and Q2, and so on if more cars are eligible.
"
104,S,2021,Qualifying Practice,"4.6.2 Any driver whose car stops on the circuit during the qualifying session will not be permitted to take any further part in the session.
"
105,S,2021,Qualifying Practice,"4.6.3 At the end of qualifying practice the times achieved by each driver will be officially published.
"
106,S,2021,Qualifying Practice,"4.6.4 An AOT, as defined in F1 Technical Regulations, must be empty during the complete qualifying
practice session.
"
107,S,2021,The Grid,"
4.7.1 Unless the track was declared wet by the race director, any driver eliminated during Q1 whose best qualifying lap exceeds 107% of the fastest time set during that session, or who fails to set a time, will not be allowed to take part in the race. Under exceptional circumstances however, which may include setting a suitable lap time in a free practice session, the stewards may permit the car to start the race.
Any driver accepted in this manner will be placed at the back of the starting grid after any other penalties have been applied, and behind any driver penalised under Article 5.7 or 5.8.
Should there be more than one driver accepted in this manner they will be arranged on the grid in the order they were classified in P3.
"
108,S,2021,The Grid,"4.7.2 The grid will be drawn up as follows:
a. The last five positions will be occupied by the cars eliminated during Q1, the fastest in
16th position.
b. The next five positions will be occupied by the cars eliminated during Q2, the fastest in 11th position.
c. The top ten positions will be occupied by the cars which took part in Q3, the fastest from the position on the grid which was the pole position in the previous year or, on a new circuit, has been designated as such by the FIA safety delegate.
If two or more drivers set identical times during Q1, Q2 or Q3 priority will be given to the one who set it first.
If more than 20 cars are entered in the Championship appropriate amendments will be made to the above in accordance with Article 4.6.1.
d. If more than one driver fails to set a time during Q2 or Q3 they will be arranged in the following order:
i. Any driver who attempted to set a qualifying time by starting a flying lap.
ii. Any driver who failed to start a flying lap.
iii. Any driver who failed to leave the pits during the period.
e. Once the grid has been established in accordance with (a) and (b) above, grid position penalties will be applied to the drivers in question in the order the offences were committed. If, following qualifying, more than one driver incurs a penalty under Article 5.7 or 5.8 preference will be given to the driver whose team first informed the technical delegate that a power unit or gearbox change will be carried out.
f. Any driver required to start the race from the back of the grid after incurring a penalty under Article 5.7.3 will be arranged on the grid behind any driver penalised under (e) above.
If more than one driver is required to start the race from the back of the grid they will be arranged in qualifying order.
g. Any driver who incurs a penalty under Article 5.7 or 5.8 will take precedence over any driver whose qualifying times have been deleted for any reason.
If more than one driver falls into a single category in b) or e) above they will be arranged on the grid in the order they were classified in the previous period of qualifying or, in the case of Q1, the order they were classified in P3.
"
109,S,2021,The Grid,"4.7.3 The starting grid will be published no less than four hours before the start of the formation lap. Any competitor whose car(s) is (are) unable to start for any reason whatsoever (or who has good reason to believe that their car(s) will not be ready to start) must inform the stewards accordingly at the earliest opportunity and, in any event, no later than one hour and fifteen minutes before the start of the formation lap. If one or more cars are withdrawn the grid will be closed up accordingly. The final starting grid will be published one hour before the start of the formation lap.
"
110,S,2021,The Grid,"4.7.4 The grid will be in a staggered 1 x 1 formation and the rows on the grid will be separated by 16 metres.
"
111,S,2021,Starting Procedure,"
4.8.1 40 minutes before the start of the formation lap the pit exit will be opened and all cars, including any that are required to start the race from the pit lane, will be permitted to leave the pit lane to cover a reconnaissance lap. Should any driver wish to cover more than one reconnaissance lap, this must be done by driving down the pit lane at greatly reduced speed between each of the laps. If a driver stops in his pit between reconnaissance laps the car may only re-join the track by being driven from the driver’s garage and not from his pit stop position.
At the end of these laps all cars starting the race from the grid should stop on the grid in starting order with their engines stopped.
All drivers going to the pit exit at this time must do so at a constant speed and with constant throttle. This applies over the whole of the pit lane whether a driver is going to the pit exit from his garage or travelling through the pit lane between reconnaissance laps.
Any car which does not complete a reconnaissance lap and reach the grid under its own power will not be permitted to start the race from the grid.
"
112,S,2021,Starting Procedure,"4.8.2 32 minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap, a warning signal will be given indicating that the end of the pit lane will be closed in two minutes.
30 minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap the end of the pit lane will be closed and a second warning signal will be given. Any car which is still in the pit lane can start from the end of the pit lane provided it got there under its own power. If more than one car is affected they must line up in the order in which they qualified. However, any car reaching the end of the pit lane after the five minute signal must start behind any car already at the pit exit.
All such cars may then join the race once the whole field has passed the end of the pit lane for the first time after the start.
"
113,S,2021,Starting Procedure,"4.8.3 The approach of the start will be announced by signals shown ten minutes, five minutes, three minutes, one-minute and fifteen seconds before the start of the formation lap, each of which will be accompanied by an audible warning.
When the ten minute signal is shown, everybody except drivers, officials and team technical staff must leave the grid.
"
114,S,2021,Starting Procedure,"4.8.4 When the three minute signal is shown all cars on the grid must have their wheels fitted, after this signal wheels may only be removed in the pit lane.
A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver whose car did not have all its wheels fully fitted at the three minute signal.
"
115,S,2021,Starting Procedure,"4.8.5 When the one minute signal is shown, engines should be started and all team personnel must leave the grid by the time the 15 second signal is given taking all equipment with them.
If any team personnel or team equipment remain on the grid after the 15 second signal has been shown the driver of the car concerned must start the race from the pit lane as specified in Article 4.8.2. A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to start the race from the pit lane.
If any driver needs assistance after the 15 second signal he must raise his arm and, when the remainder of the cars able to do so have left the grid, marshals will be instructed to push the car into the pit lane.
In either of the above cases, marshals with yellow flags will stand beside any car (or cars) concerned to warn drivers behind.
"
116,S,2021,Starting Procedure,"4.8.6 When the green lights are illuminated, all cars on the grid should begin the formation lap with the pole position driver leading.
When leaving the grid all drivers must respect the pit lane speed limit until they pass pole position.
Marshals will be instructed to push any car (or cars) which remain on the grid into the pit lane by the fastest route immediately after cars able to do so have left the grid. Any driver being pushed from the grid may not attempt to start the car and must follow the instructions of the marshals.
"
117,S,2021,Starting Procedure,"4.8.7 During the formation lap practice starts are forbidden and the formation must be kept as tight as possible.
"
118,S,2021,Starting Procedure,"4.8.8 Overtaking during the formation lap is only permitted if a car is delayed and cars behind cannot avoid passing it without unduly delaying the remainder of the field. In this case, drivers may only overtake to re-establish the original starting order. Any driver delayed in this way, and who is unable to re-establish the original starting order before he reaches the first safety car line, must enter the pit lane and start from the end of the pit lane as specified in Article 4.8.2.
A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to enter the pit lane if he has not re-established the original starting order before he reaches the first safety car line.
"
119,S,2021,Starting Procedure,"4.8.9 When the cars come back to the grid at the end of the formation lap (or laps, see Articles 4.8.14(c) and 4.15.5), they must stop within their respective starting grid positions, keeping their engines running.
There will be a standing start, the signal being given by means of lights activated by the permanent starter.
Once all the cars have come to a halt the five second light will appear followed by the four, three, two and one second lights. At any time after the one-second light appears, the race will be started by extinguishing all red lights.
If, after the start, a car is immobilised on the starting grid marshals alongside the grid will wave their yellow flags to inform the drivers that a car is stationary on the grid. It shall be the duty of the marshals to push it into the pit lane by the fastest route. Any driver being pushed from the grid may not attempt to start the car.
Once the car is in the pit lane his mechanics may attempt to start it, if successful the driver may re-join the race. The driver and mechanics must follow the instructions of the track marshals at all times during such a procedure.
"
120,S,2021,Starting Procedure,"4.8.10 Unless specifically authorised by the FIA safety delegate, during the start of a race the pit wall must be kept free of all persons with the exception of the team personnel permitted under Article 5.10.3, officials and fire marshals.
"
121,S,2021,Starting Procedure,"4.8.11 If, after returning to the starting grid at the end of the formation lap a problem arises, the following procedures shall apply:
a. If a car develops a problem that could endanger the start the driver must immediately raise his hands above his head and the marshal responsible for that row must immediately wave a yellow flag. If the race director decides the start should be aborted the green lights will be illuminated two seconds after the abort lights are switched on, a board saying “EXTRA FORMATION LAP” will be displayed and all cars able to do so must complete a further formation lap whilst the car which developed the problem is moved into the pit lane.
When leaving the grid to complete the extra formation lap all drivers must respect the pit lane speed limit until they pass pole position.
The team may then attempt to rectify the problem and, if successful, the car may then start from the end of the pit lane. Should there be more than one car involved their starting order will be determined by the order in which they reached the end of the pit lane.
Every time this happens the race will be shortened by one lap.
b. If another problem arises which does not necessitate a delay to the start (see c) below), drivers will be asked to carry out an extra formation lap as set out in a) above. Any driver who caused the start to be aborted, and is then able to start the extra formation lap must enter the pit lane at the end of the lap and start the race as specified in Article 4.8.2. A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to start the race from the pit lane.
c. If any other problem arises, and if the race director decides the start should be delayed, the following procedures shall apply:
i. If the race has not been started, the abort lights will be switched on, a board saying “DELAYED START” will be displayed, engines should be stopped and all teams will be informed of the likely delay via the official messaging system. Once the start time is known at least five minutes warning will be given.
Tyre changing on the grid is not permitted during such a delay.
Every time this happens the race will be shortened by one lap.
ii. If the race has been started the marshals alongside the grid will wave their yellow flags to inform the drivers that a car is stationary on the grid.
"
122,S,2021,Starting Procedure,"4.8.12 Should Article 4.8.11 apply, the race will nevertheless count for the Championship no matter how often the procedure is repeated, or how much the race is shortened as a result.
"
123,S,2021,Starting Procedure,"4.8.13 Either of the penalties under Articles 4.11.3(c) or d) will be imposed on any driver who is judged to have:
a. Moved before the start signal is given, such judgement being made by an FIA approved and supplied transponder fitted to each car, or ;
b. Positioned his car on the starting grid in such a way that the transponder is unable to detect the moment at which the car first moved from its grid position after the start signal is given.
"
124,S,2021,Starting Procedure,"4.8.14 Only in the following cases will any variation in the start procedure be allowed:
a. If it starts to rain after the five minute signal but before the race is started and, in the opinion of the race director teams should be given the opportunity to change tyres, the abort lights will be shown on the Line and the starting procedure will begin again at the ten minute point.
b. If the start of the race is imminent and, in the opinion of the race director, the volume of water on the track is such that it cannot be negotiated safely even on wet-weather tyres, the abort lights will be shown on the Line and all teams will be informed of the likely delay via the official messaging system. Once the start time is known at least ten minutes warning will be given.
c. If track conditions are considered unsuitable to start the race at the scheduled time the start of the formation lap may take place behind the safety car. If this is the case, at the ten minute signal its orange lights will be illuminated, this being the signal to the drivers that the formation lap will be started behind the safety car. At the same time this will be confirmed to all teams via the official messaging system.
When the green lights are illuminated the safety car will leave the grid and all drivers must follow in grid order, no more than ten car lengths apart, and must respect the pit lane speed limit until they pass pole position. The safety car will continue until conditions are considered suitable for racing.
Any cars that were starting the race from the pit lane may join the formation lap once the whole field has passed the end of the pit lane for the first time. Any such cars may complete all formation laps but must enter the pit lane after the safety car returns to the pits and start the race from the end of the pit lane in the order they get there.
Any other car entering the pit lane during the formation laps may re-join the track but must enter the pit lane after the safety car returns to the pits and start the race from the end of the pit lane in the order they get there.
A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver whose tyre(s) are changed for a different specification before the start of the race.
Overtaking during the lap(s) behind the safety car is only permitted under the following circumstances:
i. If a car is delayed when leaving the grid and cars behind cannot avoid passing it without unduly delaying the remainder of the field, or
ii. If there is more than one car starting from the pit lane and one of them is unduly delayed.
In either case drivers may only overtake to re-establish the original starting order or the order the cars at the pit exit were in when the formation lap was started.
Any driver delayed in either way, and who is unable to re-establish the original starting order before he reaches the first safety car line on the lap the safety car returns to the pits, must enter the pit lane and may only join the race once the whole field has passed the end of the pit lane after the start of the race.
A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to enter the pit lane if he has not re-established the original starting order before he reaches the first safety car line on the lap the safety car returns to the pits.
When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to call in the safety car a message “STANDING START” will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will display “SS” and the car's orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the teams and drivers that it will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap.
At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall more than ten car lengths behind it.
Once the safety car has entered the pit lane all cars, with the exception of those required to start from the pit lane, must return to the grid, take up their grid positions and follow the procedures set out in Article 4.8.9 to 4.8.13.
If, after several formation laps behind the safety car, track conditions are considered unsuitable to start the race from a standing start, the message “ROLLING START” will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will display “RS” and the car's orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the teams and drivers that it will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap.
At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall more than ten car lengths behind it.
As the safety car is approaching the pit entry the FIA light panels will be extinguished and replaced by waved green flags with green lights at the Line.
No driver may overtake another car on the track until he passes the Line (see Article 3.1.3) for the first time after the safety car has returned to the pits. The race will be deemed to have started when the leading car crosses the Line after the safety car has returned to the pits.
If, after several formation laps behind the safety car, track conditions are considered unsuitable to start the race, the message “START PROCEDURE SUSPENDED” will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system and all cars must enter the pit lane behind the safety car. The procedures described in Articles 4.14 and 4.15 must then be followed and there will be no standing start.
"
125,S,2021,The Race,"
During the race, drivers leaving the pit lane may only do so when the light at the end of the pit lane is green and on their own responsibility. A marshal with a blue flag and/or a flashing blue light, will also warn the driver if cars are approaching on the track.
"
126,S,2021,Devices to facilitate overtaking,"
4.10.1 Driver adjustable bodywork permitted by Article 3.10.10 of the Technical Regulations:
a. The adjustable bodywork may only be activated by the driver in any of the pre- determined activation zones around each circuit. In conditions of poor visibility however
the race director may, at his absolute discretion, disable all such systems until conditions improve.
If the adjustable bodywork is disabled in this way at any time during any of the three periods of the qualifying practice session (Q1, Q2 or Q3) it will remain disabled for the remainder of the relevant period.
b. For the sole purpose of improving overtaking opportunities during the race the adjustable bodywork may be activated by the driver after he has completed two laps after the race start or following a safety car period.
The driver may only activate the adjustable bodywork in the race when he has been notified via the control electronics (see Article 8.2 of the F1 Technical Regulations) that it is enabled. It will be enabled, and may only be used by the driver, if he is less than one second behind another at any of the pre-determined detection points around each circuit.
The system will be disabled by the control electronics the first time the driver uses the brakes after he has activated the system. In conditions of poor visibility, or if yellow flags are being shown in the activation zone, the race director may, at his absolute discretion, disable all such systems until conditions improve or yellow flags are withdrawn.
The FIA may, after consulting all competitors, adjust the above time proximity in order to ensure the stated purpose of the adjustable bodywork is met.
c. In the event of a failure in the system which notifies the driver that he was within one second of the car in front, and is hence authorised to use the adjustable bodywork, the team concerned may ask the race director for permission to override the system. If permission is given in this way the onus will be upon the team concerned to ensure that their driver only uses the adjustable bodywork if he is within one second of the car in front of him.
If the failure in the system is rectified the driver may no longer use this override, the race director will notify the team if and when the fault has been remedied.
"
127,S,2021,Incidents During the Race,"
4.11.1 The race director may report any on-track incident or suspected breach of the Sporting Regulations or the International Sporting Code (an “Incident”) to the stewards. After review it shall be at the discretion of the stewards to decide whether or not to proceed with an investigation.
The stewards may also investigate an Incident noted by themselves.
"
128,S,2021,Incidents During the Race,"4.11.2 It shall be at the discretion of the stewards to decide if any driver involved in an Incident should be penalised. Unless it is clear to the stewards that a driver or drivers were wholly or predominantly to blame for an Incident no penalty will be imposed.
If an Incident is under investigation by the stewards a message informing all teams which driver or drivers are involved will be sent via the official messaging system.
Provided that such a message is displayed no later than 60 minutes after the race has finished the driver or drivers concerned may not leave the circuit without the consent of the stewards.
"
129,S,2021,Incidents During the Race,"4.11.3 The stewards may impose any one of the penalties below on any driver involved in an Incident:
a. A five second time penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane, stop in his pit stop position for at least five seconds and then re-join the race. The relevant driver may however elect not to stop, provided he carries out no further pit stop before the end of the race. In such cases five seconds will be added to the elapsed race time of the driver concerned.
b. A ten second time penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane, stop in his pit stop position for at least ten seconds and then re-join the race. The relevant driver may however elect not to stop, provided he carries out no further pit stop before the end of the race. In such cases ten seconds will be added to the elapsed race time of the driver concerned.
In both of the above cases the driver concerned must carry out the penalty the next time he enters the pit lane and, for the avoidance of doubt, this includes any stop the driver makes whilst a VSC or safety car procedure is in use.
c. A drive-through penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane and re-join the race without stopping.
d. A ten second stop-and-go time penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane, stop in his pit stop position for at least ten seconds and then re-join the race.
If any of the four penalties above are imposed upon a driver, and that driver is unable to serve the penalty due to retirement from the race, the stewards may impose a grid place penalty on the driver at his next Competition.
If any of the four penalties above are imposed during the last three laps, or after the end of a race, Article 4.11.4(b) below will not apply and five seconds will be added to the elapsed race time of the driver concerned in the case of (a) above, 10 seconds in the case of (b), 20 seconds in the case of (c) and 30 seconds in the case of (d).
e. A time penalty.
f. A reprimand.
g. A drop of any number of grid positions at the driver’s next Competition.
If any of the seven penalties above are imposed they shall not be subject to appeal.
h. Disqualification from the results.
i. Suspension from the driver’s next Competition.
"
130,S,2021,Incidents During the Race,"4.11.4 Should the stewards decide to impose either of the penalties under Article 4.11.3(a), (b), (c) or (d), the following procedure will be followed:
a. The stewards will give written notification of the penalty which has been imposed to the competitor concerned and will inform all teams via the official messaging system.
b. With the exception of Articles 4.11.3(a) and (b) above, from the time the team concerned is notified of the stewards’ decision via the official messaging system the relevant driver may cross the Line on the track no more than twice before entering the pit lane and, in the case of a penalty under Article 4.11.3(d), proceeding to his pit stop position where he shall remain for the period of the time penalty.
However, unless the driver was already in the pit entry for the purpose of serving his penalty, he may not carry out the penalty if the VSC procedure is in use or after the safety car has been deployed. The number of times the driver crosses the Line behind the safety car or during the VSC procedure will be added to the maximum number of times he may cross the Line on the track.
c. Whilst a car is stationary in the pit lane as a result of incurring a penalty under Articles 4.11.3(a) or (b) above it may not be worked on until the car has been stationary for the duration of the penalty.
d. Whilst a car is stationary in the pit lane as a result of incurring a time penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) above it may not be worked on. However, if the engine stops any work necessary to re-start it may be carried out after the time penalty period has elapsed. If the team is unable to start the engine the car may then only be worked on in the driver’s garage.
e. Any breach or failure to comply with Articles 4.11.4 (b), (c) or (d) may result in the car being disqualified."
131,S,2021,Safety Car,"
4.12.1 The FIA safety car will be driven by an FIA appointed driver and will carry an FIA observer capable
of recognising all the competing cars who is in permanent radio contact with race control.
"
132,S,2021,Safety Car,"4.12.2 Fifty minutes before the start of the formation lap the safety car will leave the pit lane and take up position at the front of the grid and remain there until the five minute signal is given. At this point (except under Article 4.8.14(c)) it will cover a whole lap of the circuit and take up position.
"
133,S,2021,Safety Car,"4.12.3 The safety car may be brought into operation to neutralise a race upon the order of the clerk of the course.
It will be used only if competitors or officials are in immediate physical danger on or near the track but the circumstances are not such as to necessitate suspending the race.
"
134,S,2021,Safety Car,"4.12.4 When the order is given to deploy the safety car the message ""SAFETY CAR DEPLOYED"" will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will display “SC” and all marshal's posts will display waved yellow flags and ""SC"" boards for the duration of the intervention.
"
135,S,2021,Safety Car,"4.12.5 No car may be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be deemed potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person at any time whilst the safety car is deployed. This will apply whether any such car is being driven on the track, the pit entry or the pit lane.
"
136,S,2021,Safety Car,"4.12.6 The safety car will join the track with its orange lights illuminated and will do so regardless of where the race leader is.
"
137,S,2021,Safety Car,"4.12.7 All competing cars must reduce speed and form up in line behind the safety car no more than ten car lengths apart. In order to ensure that drivers reduce speed sufficiently, from the time at which all teams have been sent the “SAFETY CAR DEPLOYED” message via the official messaging system until the time that each car crosses the first safety car line for the second time, drivers must stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU at least once in each marshalling sector and at both the first and second safety car lines (a marshalling sector is defined as the section of track between each of the FIA light panels).
The stewards may impose either of the penalties under Article 4.11.3(a), (b), (c) or (d) on any driver who fails to stay above the minimum time as required by the above.
"
138,S,2021,Safety Car,"4.12.8 With the exception of the cases listed under (a) to (h) below, no driver may overtake another car on the track, including the safety car, until he passes the Line (see Article 3.1.3) for the first time after the safety car has returned to the pits.
The exceptions are:
a. If a driver is signalled to do so from the safety car.
b. Under 4.8.14(c) or 4.12.12 below.
c. When entering the pits a driver may pass another car remaining on the track, including the safety car, after he has reached the first safety car line.
d. When leaving the pits a driver may overtake, or be overtaken by, another car on the track before he reaches the second safety car line.
e. When the safety car is returning to the pits it may be overtaken by cars on the track once it has reached the first safety car line.
f. Whilst in the pit entry, pit lane or pit exit a driver may overtake another car which is also in one of these three areas.
g. Any car stopping in its designated garage area whilst the safety car is using the pit lane (see 4.12.11 below) may be overtaken.
h. If any car slows with an obvious problem.
"
139,S,2021,Safety Car,"4.12.9 When ordered to do so by the clerk of the course the observer in the car will use a green light to signal to any cars between it and the race leader that they should pass. These cars will continue at reduced speed and without overtaking until they reach the line of cars behind the safety car.
"
140,S,2021,Safety Car,"4.12.10 Except under 4.12.12 below, the safety car shall be used at least until the leader is behind it and all remaining cars are lined up behind him.
Once behind the safety car, the race leader must keep within ten car lengths of it (except under 4.12.13 below).
"
141,S,2021,Safety Car,"4.12.11 Under certain circumstances the clerk of the course may ask the cars and the safety car to use the pit lane. In these cases, a signal to use the pit lane will be displayed before the start of the pit entry and all teams will be informed via the official messaging system, all cars must then enter the pit lane, drive through it and re-join the track. Any car entering the pit lane under these circumstances may however stop at its designated garage area. A penalty under Article 4.11.3(c) will be imposed on any driver who fails to enter the pit lane when required to do so.
Other than when the cars and the safety car are required to use the pit lane, no car may enter the pits whilst the safety car is deployed unless it is for the purpose of changing tyres.
"
142,S,2021,Safety Car,"4.12.12 If the clerk of the course considers it safe to do so, and the message ""LAPPED CARS MAY NOW OVERTAKE"" has been sent to all teams via the official messaging system, any cars that have been lapped by the leader will be required to pass the cars on the lead lap and the safety car.
This will only apply to cars that were lapped at the time they crossed the Line at the end of the lap during which they crossed the first Safety Car line for the second time after the safety car was deployed.
Having overtaken the cars on the lead lap and the safety car these cars should then proceed around the track at an appropriate speed, without overtaking, and make every effort to take up position at the back of the line of cars behind the safety car. Whilst they are overtaking, and in order to ensure this may be carried out safely, the cars on the lead lap must always stay on the racing line unless deviating from it is unavoidable. Unless the clerk of the course considers the presence of the safety car is still necessary, once the last lapped car has passed the leader the safety car will return to the pits at the end of the following lap.
If the clerk of the course considers track conditions are unsuitable for overtaking the message ""OVERTAKING WILL NOT BE PERMITTED"" will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system.
"
143,S,2021,Safety Car,"4.12.13 When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to call in the safety car the message ""SAFETY CAR IN THIS LAP"" will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system and the car's orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the teams and drivers that it will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap.
At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall more than ten car lengths behind it.
In order to avoid the likelihood of accidents before the safety car returns to the pits, from the point at which the lights on the car are turned out drivers must proceed at a pace which involves no erratic acceleration or braking nor any other manoeuvre which is likely to endanger other drivers or impede the restart.
As the safety car is approaching the pit entry the SC boards will be withdrawn and, other than on the last lap of the race, as the leader approaches the Line the yellow flags will be withdrawn and a green flag will be displayed at the Line.
"
144,S,2021,Safety Car,"4.12.14 Each lap completed while the safety car is deployed will be counted as a race lap. However, if the procedure set out in Article 4.8.14(c) is followed Article 3.1.3(c) will apply.
"
145,S,2021,Safety Car,"4.12.15 If the safety car is still deployed at the beginning of the last lap, or is deployed during the last lap, it will enter the pit lane at the end of the lap and the cars will take the end-of-race signal as normal without overtaking.
"
146,S,2021,Virtual Safety Car (VSC),"
4.13.1 The VSC procedure may be initiated to neutralise a practice session or a race upon the order of
the clerk of the course.
It will normally be used when double waved yellow flags are needed on any section of track and competitors or officials may be in danger, but the circumstances are not such as to warrant use of the safety car itself.
"
147,S,2021,Virtual Safety Car (VSC),"4.13.2 When the order is given to initiate the VSC procedure a message ""VSC DEPLOYED"" will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system and all FIA light panels will display “VSC”.
"
148,S,2021,Virtual Safety Car (VSC),"4.13.3 No car may be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be deemed potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person at any time whilst the VSC procedure is in use. This will apply whether any such car is being driven on the track, the pit entry or the pit lane.
"
149,S,2021,Virtual Safety Car (VSC),"4.13.4 When initiated during a race, no car may enter the pits whilst the VSC procedure is in use unless it is for the purpose of changing tyres.
"
150,S,2021,Virtual Safety Car (VSC),"4.13.5 All competing cars must reduce speed and stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU at least once in each marshalling sector and at both the first and second safety car lines (a marshalling sector is defined as the section of track between each of the FIA light panels).
All cars must also be above this minimum time when the FIA light panels change to green (see 4.13.7 below).
When initiated during a race, the stewards may impose either of the penalties under Article 4.11.3(a), (b), (c) or (d) on any driver who fails to stay above the minimum time as required by the above.
"
151,S,2021,Virtual Safety Car (VSC),"4.13.6 With the exception of the cases listed under a) to d) below, no driver may overtake another car on the track whilst the VSC procedure is in use.
The exceptions are:
a. When entering the pits a driver may pass another car remaining on the track after he has reached the first safety car line.
b. When leaving the pits a driver may overtake, or be overtaken by, another car on the track before he reaches the second safety car line.
c. Whilst in the pit entry, pit lane or pit exit a driver may overtake another car which is also in one of these three areas.
d. If any car slows with an obvious problem.
"
152,S,2021,Virtual Safety Car (VSC),"4.13.7 When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to end the VSC procedure the message ""VSC ENDING"" will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system and, at any time between 10 and 15 seconds later, “VSC” on the FIA light panels will change to green and drivers may continue the session or continue racing immediately. After 30 seconds the green lights will be extinguished.
"
153,S,2021,Virtual Safety Car (VSC),"4.13.8 Each lap completed whist the VSC procedure is in use during a race will be counted as a race lap.
"
154,S,2021,Suspending a Race,"
4.14.1 If competitors or officials are placed in immediate physical danger by cars running on the track, and the clerk of the course deems circumstances are such that the track cannot be negotiated safely, even behind the safety car, the race will be suspended.
Should it become necessary to suspend the race, the clerk of the course will order red flags to be shown at all marshal posts and the abort lights to be shown at the Line.
"
155,S,2021,Suspending a Race,"4.14.2 When the signal is given overtaking is forbidden, the pit exit will be closed and all cars must proceed slowly into the pit lane. The first car to arrive in the pit lane should proceed directly to the pit exit staying in the fast lane, all the other cars should form up in a line behind the first car.
"
156,S,2021,Suspending a Race,"4.14.3 Any cars unable to return to the pit lane as a result of the track being blocked will be brought back when the track is cleared and will be arranged in the order they occupied before the race was suspended.
Additionally, any cars in the pit lane or pit entry at the time the race was suspended will be arranged in the order they occupied before the race was suspended. Any cars in their garage at the time the race was suspended will be arranged at the back of the line of cars in the fast lane in the order they got there. Any such cars will be permitted to leave the pit lane when the race is resumed but must re-enter the pit lane when the safety car returns and may join the race once the last car has passed the pit exit after the re-start (also see Article 4.15.8).
In all cases the order will be taken at the last point at which it was possible to determine the position of all cars. All such cars will then be permitted to resume the race.
The Safety Car will then be driven to the front of the line of cars in the fast lane.
"
157,S,2021,Suspending a Race,"4.14.4 Whilst the race is suspended:
a. Neither the race nor the timekeeping system will stop, however, in accordance with Article 3.1.3 the length of the race suspension will be added to the maximum two hour period.
b. Cars may be worked on once they have stopped in the fast lane but any such work is restricted to that listed in i) to ix) below and must not impede the resumption of the race.
i. Starting the engine and any directly associated preparation.
ii. The addition of compressed gases (see Article 4.5 of the F1 Technical Regulations).
iii. The fitting or removal of permitted cooling and heating devices.
iv. Changes to the air ducts around the front and rear brakes.
v. Changes to the radiator ducts.
vi. Changes made for driver comfort.
vii. Changing wheels and tyres.
viii. Repair of genuine accident damage, including the replacement of assemblies containing such damaged parts.
ix. The aerodynamic set up of the front wing may be adjusted using the existing parts. No parts may be added, removed or replaced.
c. Only team members, officials and duly accredited television cameramen will be permitted in the pit lane.
"
158,S,2021,Suspending a Race,"4.14.5 Unless asked to do so by the FIA, cars may not be moved from the fast lane whilst the race is suspended. A penalty under Article 4.11.3(c) will be imposed on any driver whose car is moved from the fast lane to any other part of the pit lane.
At all times drivers must follow the directions of the marshals.
"
159,S,2021,Resuming a Race,"
4.15.1 The delay will be kept as short as possible and as soon as a resumption time is known all teams will be informed via the official messaging system, in all cases at least ten minutes warning will be given.
"
160,S,2021,Resuming a Race,"4.15.2 Signals will be shown ten minutes, five minutes, three minutes, one minute and fifteen seconds before the resumption and each of these will be accompanied by an audible warning.
"
161,S,2021,Resuming a Race,"4.15.3 When the three minute signal is shown all cars must have their wheels fitted, after this signal wheels may only be removed if the car has been moved out of the fast lane or during a further race suspension.
A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver whose car did not have all its wheels fully fitted at the three minute signal or has any of its wheels changed before it leaves the pit lane after the race has been resumed.
At the two minute point any cars between the safety car and the leader, in addition to any cars that had been lapped by the leader at the time the race was suspended, will be allowed to leave the pit lane and complete a further lap, without overtaking, and join the line of cars behind the safety car which left the pit lane when the race was resumed.
"
162,S,2021,Resuming a Race,"4.15.4 When the one minute signal is shown, engines should be started and all team personnel must leave the fast lane by the time the 15 second signal is given taking all equipment with them. If any driver needs assistance after the 15 second signal he must raise his arm and, when the remainder of the cars able to do so have left the pit lane, marshals will be instructed to push the car into the slow lane. In this case, marshals with yellow flags will stand beside any car (or cars) concerned to warn drivers behind. Drivers may leave the fast lane in order to pass any car unable to leave the pit lane.
"
163,S,2021,Resuming a Race,"4.15.5 The race will be resumed behind the safety car when the green lights are illuminated. The safety car will enter the pits after one lap unless:
a. The race is being resumed in wet conditions and the race director deems more than one lap necessary, in which case see Article 6.4(m).
b. All cars are not yet in a line behind the safety car.
c. A further incident occurs necessitating another intervention.
When the green lights are illuminated the safety car will leave the pit lane and all drivers must follow, no more than ten car lengths apart.
"
164,S,2021,Resuming a Race,"4.15.6 Overtaking behind the safety car is only permitted in the following cases:
a. Any driver who is delayed when leaving his position in the fast lane or during the lap(s) behind the safety car may overtake to re-establish his original starting position provided he does so before he crosses the first safety car line on the lap the safety car returns to the pits. Should he fail to do so he must re-enter the pit lane and may only re-join the race once the whole field has passed the end of the pit lane after the race has been resumed.
A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to re-enter the pit lane if he has not re-established the original starting order before he reaches the first safety car line on the lap the safety car returns to the pits.
b. Drivers may leave the fast lane in order to overtake any car delayed when leaving its position in the fast lane.
Any driver whose car has been pushed from the fast lane, in accordance with Article 4.15.4 above, may not overtake in order to re-establish the order before the race was suspended.
"
165,S,2021,Resuming a Race,"4.15.7 Either of the penalties under Article 4.11.3(c) or (d) will be imposed on any driver who, in the opinion of the stewards, unnecessarily overtook another car during the lap (or laps).
"
166,S,2021,Resuming a Race,"4.15.8 When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to call in the safety car a message “STANDING START” will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will display “SS” and the car's orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the teams and drivers that it will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap.
At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall more than ten car lengths behind it.
Once the safety car has entered the pit lane all cars, with the exception of those that were in their garage at the time the race was suspended (see Article 4.14.3), must return to the grid, take up their grid positions and follow the procedures set out in Article 4.8.9 to 4.8.13.
"
167,S,2021,Resuming a Race,"4.15.9 If, after several laps behind the safety car, track conditions are considered unsuitable to start the race from a standing start, the message “ROLLING START” will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will display “RS” and the car's orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the teams and drivers that it will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap.
At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall more than ten car lengths behind it.
As the safety car is approaching the pit entry the FIA light panels will be extinguished and replaced by waved green flags with green lights at the Line.
No driver may overtake another car on the track until he passes the Line (see Article 3.1.3) for the first time after the safety car has returned to the pits.
Each lap completed while the safety car is deployed will be counted as a race lap.
"
168,S,2021,Resuming a Race,"4.15.10 If, after several laps behind the safety car, track conditions are considered unsuitable to resume racing at all, the message “RE-START PROCEDURE SUSPENDED” will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system and all cars must enter the pit lane behind the safety car. The procedures set out in Articles 4.14 and 4.15.1-4.15.7 must then be followed and there will be no standing start.
"
169,S,2021,Resuming a Race,4.15.11 If the race cannot be resumed the results will be taken at the end of the penultimate lap before the lap during which the signal to suspend the race was given.
170,S,2021,Finish,"
4.16.1 A chequered light panel will be the end-of-race signal and will be shown at the Line as soon as
the leading car has covered the full race distance in accordance with Article 3.1.3.
"
171,S,2021,Finish,"4.16.2 Should for any reason the end-of-race signal be given before the leading car completes the scheduled number of laps, or the prescribed time has been completed, the race will be deemed to have finished when the leading car last crossed the Line before the signal was given.
Should the end-of- race signal be delayed for any reason, the race will be deemed to have finished when it should have finished.
"
172,S,2021,Finish,"4.16.3 After receiving the end-of-race signal all cars must proceed on the circuit directly to the post-race parc fermé without any unnecessary delay, without receiving any object whatsoever and without any assistance (except that of the marshals if necessary).
An exception to Article 4.1.4 and to the above will be made for the winning driver who may perform an act of celebration before reaching parc fermé, provided any such act:
a. Is performed safely and does not endanger other drivers or any officials.
b. Does not call into question the legality of his car.
c. Does not delay the podium ceremony.
Any classified car which cannot reach the post-race parc fermé under its own power will be placed under the exclusive control of the marshals who will take the car to the parc fermé.
"
173,S,2021,Classification,"
4.17.1 The car placed first will be the one having covered the scheduled distance in the shortest time, or, where appropriate, passed the Line in the lead at the end of two hours (or more under Article 3.1.3). All cars will be classified taking into account the number of complete laps they have covered, and for those which have completed the same number of laps, the order in which they crossed the Line.
"
174,S,2021,Classification,"4.17.2 Cars having covered less than 90% of the number of laps covered by the winner (rounded down to the nearest whole number of laps), will not be classified.
"
175,S,2021,Classification,"4.17.3 The official classification will be published after the race. It will be the only valid result subject to any amendments which may be made under the International Sporting Code and the Sporting Regulations.
"
176,S,2021,Scrutineering,"
5.1.1 Each competitor will be required to carry out initial scrutineering of his cars and submit the duly
completed declaration no later than 1.5 hours before the start of P1.
The declaration form template may be found in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations.
"
177,S,2021,Scrutineering,"5.1.2 Unless a waiver is granted by the stewards, competitors who do not keep to these time limits will not be allowed to take part in the Competition.
"
178,S,2021,Scrutineering,"5.1.3 No car may take part in the Competition until the declaration described in Article 5.1.1 above has been submitted, and the FIA technical delegate has confirmed to the competitor that he is satisfied it has been fully and correctly completed.
"
179,S,2021,Scrutineering,"5.1.4 Any competitor whose car has a change of survival cell after initial scrutineering (see Article 5.1.1 above) must complete a new declaration for approval by the FIA technical delegate. However, any such car may not be used until the following day.
"
180,S,2021,Scrutineering,"5.1.5 The bodywork (excluding radiators) of each car as presented for initial scrutineering will establish the Reference Specification and the car must be returned to this before the start of P3. The procedure to establish conformity with this article is described in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations.
"
181,S,2021,Scrutineering,"5.1.6 The scrutineers may:
a. Check the eligibility of a car or of a competitor at any time during a Competition.

c. Require a competitor to pay the reasonable expenses which exercise of the powers mentioned in this Article may entail.
d. Require a competitor to supply them with such parts or samples as they may deem necessary.
"
182,S,2021,Scrutineering,"5.1.7 The race director or the clerk of the course may require that any car involved in an accident be stopped and checked.
"
183,S,2021,Scrutineering,"5.1.8 Checks and scrutineering shall be carried out by duly appointed officials who shall also be responsible for the operation of the parc fermé and who alone are authorised to give instructions to the competitors.
"
184,S,2021,Scrutineering,"5.1.9 The stewards will publish the findings of the scrutineers each time cars are checked during the Competition. These results will not include any specific figure except when a car is found to be in breach of the Technical Regulations.
"
185,S,2021,Weighing,"
5.2.1 After any free practice session or during the qualifying practice session cars will be weighed as
follows:
a. When signalled to do so the driver will proceed directly to the FIA garage and stop his engine.
Any driver who fails to stop when asked to do so, and then fails to bring the car back to the FIA garage, or if work is carried out on the car before it is returned to the FIA garage, will be referred to the stewards.
b. At the end of the qualifying session all cars which took part in Q3 will be weighed. If a driver wishes to leave his car before it is weighed he must ask the technical delegate to weigh him in order that this weight may be added to that of the car.
c. If a car stops on the circuit during the qualifying session and the driver leaves the car, he must go to the FIA garage immediately on his return to the pit lane in order for his weight to be established.
"
186,S,2021,Weighing,"5.2.2 After the race any classified car may be weighed. If a driver wishes to leave his car before it is weighed he must ask the technical delegate to weigh him in order that this weight may be added to that of the car.
"
187,S,2021,Weighing,"5.2.3 The relevant car may be disqualified should its weight be less than that specified in Article 4.1 of the Technical Regulations when weighed under (a) or (b) above, save where the deficiency in weight results from the accidental loss of a component of the car.
"
188,S,2021,Weighing,"5.2.4 No substance may be added to, placed on, or removed from a car after it has been selected for weighing or has finished the race or during the weighing procedure. (Except by a scrutineer when acting in his official capacity).
"
189,S,2021,Weighing,"5.2.5 In the event of any breach of these provisions for the weighing of cars the stewards may drop the driver such number of grid positions as they consider appropriate or disqualify him from the race.
"
190,S,2021,Refueling,"
5.3.1 General provisions
a. Refuelling is only permitted in the team’s designated garages.

194,S,2021,Pre-Race Parc Fermé,"
5.4.1 Every team must provide the FIA technical delegate with a suspension set-up sheet for both of
their cars before each of them leaves the pit lane for the first time during qualifying
"
195,S,2021,Pre-Race Parc Fermé,"5.4.2 Each car will be deemed to be in parc fermé from the time at which it leaves the pit lane for the first time during P3 until the start of the race. From this point, all cars must be presented in their
Reference Specification. Any car which fails to leave the pit lane during P3 will be deemed to be in parc fermé at the end of P3.
From this point until the start of qualifying the following work may be carried out:
a. Engines may be started.
b. Wheels, wheel fasteners and tyres may be removed, changed or rebalanced and tyre pressures adjusted.
c. Spark plugs may be removed in order to carry out an internal engine inspection and cylinder compression checks.
d. Permitted breather, heating or cooling devices may be fitted.
e. A jump battery may be connected and on board electrical units may be freely accessed via a physical connection to the car.
f. Charging and / or discharging of the ERS energy storage devices.
g. Compressed gases may be drained or added.
h. Fluids may be drained, bled and/or replenished, however, fluids used for replenishment must conform to the same specification as the original fluid.
i. The aerodynamic set up of the front wing may be adjusted using the existing parts. No parts may be added, removed or replaced.
j. If the FIA technical delegate is satisfied that changes in climatic conditions necessitate alterations to the specification of a car, changes may be made to the air ducts around the front and rear brakes and radiator ducts. These changes may be made at any time after all teams have been sent the message “CHANGE IN CLIMATIC CONDITIONS” via the official messaging system. From this point onwards the choice of air ducts around the front and rear brakes and radiator ducts is free and pitot tubes may be covered or uncovered, subject always to compliance with the relevant Technical Regulations.
k. Bodywork (excluding primary heat exchangers) may be removed
l. Cosmetic changes may be made to the bodywork and tape may be added.
m. Any part of the car may be cleaned.
n. On board cameras, marshalling system components, timing transponders and any associated equipment may be removed, refitted or checked.
o. Any work required by the FIA technical delegate.
p. Changes to improve the driver's comfort. In this context anything other than the adjustment of mirrors, seat belts and pedals may only be carried out with the specific permission of the FIA technical delegate.
Should ambient temperature change significantly, teams will be requested to change the head padding required by Article 12.6.1-6 of the Technical Regulations via the official messaging system.
The addition or removal of padding (or similar material) is also permitted but may only be carried out under supervision and, if required by the FIA technical delegate, must be removed before the post-race weighing procedure.
q. Drinking fluid for the driver may be added at any time, however, the capacity of the container for any such fluid must not exceed 1.5 litres.
r. Repair of genuine accident damage.
s. Any parts which are removed from the car in order to carry out any work specifically permitted above, or any parts removed to carry out essential safety checks, must remain close to it and, at all times, be visible to the scrutineer assigned to the relevant car.
Furthermore, any parts removed from the car in order to carry out any such work must be refitted before the car leaves the pit lane.
In addition to the above, from the time at which each car leaves the pit lane for the first time in P3 until the time it leaves the pit lane for the first time in qualifying (or failing that the end of Q1), the following work may be carried out:
t. Suspension elements as described in Article 10.4.2 and 10.4.3 of the Technical Regulations may be changed, as well as any adjustment made to suspension components defined in Article 10.3 of the Technical Regulations with the aim to adjust camber, toe or ride height.
u. Weight distribution may be altered.
v. Engine and gearbox cooling may be adjusted by altering the apertures described in Article 3.7.6 (b) and (c) of the Technical Regulations.
w. Brake ducts as described in Article 3.13 of the Technical Regulations may be changed.
x. The aerodynamic set up of the rear wing may be changed in order to achieve the necessary level of Aerodynamic Drag. In order to do so, it is permissible to change all the components of the Rear Wing, as defined in Article 3.10 of the Technical Regulations. However, below Z=650 these changes may only entail components which have the same Aerodynamic surfaces to the components that are being replaced, with the exception of the Gurney of the Rear Wing Beam. Additionally, the Competitor should be able to demonstrate to the FIA, if requested, that the replaced components are required for the purposes of adjusting Aerodynamic Drag, and not as part of experimentation or development.
"
196,S,2021,Pre-Race Parc Fermé,"5.4.3 Any work not listed above may only be undertaken with the approval of the FIA technical delegate following a written request from the team concerned. It must be clear that any replacement part a team wishes to fit is the same in design and similar in mass, inertia and function to the original. Any parts removed will be retained by the FIA.
However, if a team wishes to change a part during P3, the qualifying session, between reconnaissance laps and/or on the grid before the start of the race, this may be done without first seeking the permission of the technical delegate, provided it is reasonable for the relevant team to believe permission would be given if there was time to ask and the broken or damaged part remains in full view of the scrutineer assigned to the car at all times.

The FIA reserves the right to issue guidelines to ensure this requirement is being met.
c. The only sets of tyres which may be used during a Competition are those which are defined in Article 6.2(a).
Any driver who uses a set of tyres of differing specifications during the race may not complete more than three laps on this set before changing them for a set of tyres of the same specification. A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who does not change tyres within three laps. For the avoidance of doubt, a set of tyres of differing specifications will not be considered when assessing the number of specifications used during the race.
d. e. f.
g.
h.
Tyres will only be deemed to have been used once the car’s timing transponder has shown that it has left the pit lane.
If an additional driver is used (see Article 3.12.2) he must use the tyres allocated to the nominated driver he replaced.
If an additional specification of dry-weather tyre is made available in accordance with Article 6.1(b) two sets of these tyres will be allocated to each driver for use during P1 and P2. Any such tyres must be electronically returned no later than two hours after the end of P2.
If either P1 or P2 are declared wet one additional set of intermediate tyres will be made available to any driver who used a set of intermediate tyres during either session. Under such circumstances, one used set of intermediate tyres must be electronically returned before the start of the qualifying practice session.
If neither P1 nor P2 are declared wet, but the likelihood of P3 being declared wet is deemed by the FIA to be high, one additional set of intermediate tyres will be made available to all drivers. Under such circumstances, one set of intermediate tyres must be electronically returned before the start of the qualifying practice session.
From the thirteen sets of dry-weather tyres allocated to each driver under Article 6.2(c):
i. One set of the mandatory Q3 tyre specification may not be used nor returned before Q3 and, for the cars that qualified for Q3, one set of the same specification must be electronically returned no later than three and a half hours after the end of Q3.
ii. Two sets of the mandatory race specification(s) may not be returned before the race. For the avoidance of doubt, if there are two mandatory race tyre specifications, one set of each specification may not be returned before the race.
From the ten remaining sets:
iii. One set, which each competitor must nominate prior to the start of P1 (or may re- nominate with the consent of the FIA technical delegate), may only be used during the first 40 minutes of the session. If the session is stopped during the first 40 minutes the length of the stoppage will be added to the 40-minute limit. Should P1 be declared wet, use will be extended for the remainder of the session. This extension will only be available to drivers who have covered more than one installation lap on either an intermediate or wet tyre.
iv. One further set must be electronically returned no later than two hours after the end of P1.
v. Two further sets must be electronically returned no later than two hours after the end of P2 unless both P1 and P2 are either declared wet or cancelled, in which case one of these sets may be retained by each driver but must be electronically returned no later than two hours after the end of P3.
vi. Two further sets must be electronically returned no later than two hours after the end of P3.
Once all tyres have been returned electronically after P2 and the qualifying practice session the Supplier will publish a list of the tyres which each driver has available to him for the remainder of the Competition.
Prior to the start of the qualifying practice session intermediate and wet-weather tyres may only be used after the track has been declared wet by the race director, following which intermediate, wet or dry-weather tyres may be used for the remainder of the session.
k. With the exception of any cars that are required to start the race from the pitlane, at the start of the race each car which qualified for Q3 must be fitted with the tyres with which the driver set his fastest time during Q2. This will only be necessary for these cars if dry- weather tyres were used to set the fastest time in Q2 and if dry-weather tyres are used at the start of the race.
Any such tyres damaged during Q2 will be inspected by the FIA technical delegate who will decide, at his absolute discretion, whether any may be replaced and, if so, which tyres they should be replaced with.
A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver whose car is not fitted with the tyres with which he set his fastest time in Q2 (except if damaged tyres have been replaced with the approval of the FIA technical delegate).
l. Unless he has used intermediate or wet-weather tyres during the race, each driver must use at least two different specifications of dry-weather tyres during the race, at least one of which must be a mandatory dry-weather race tyre specification as defined in Article 6.2(b). Unless a race is suspended and cannot be re-started, failure to comply with this requirement will result in the disqualification of the relevant driver from the race results.
If the race is suspended and cannot be re-started, thirty seconds will be added to the elapsed time of any driver who was unable to use at least two specifications of dry- weather tyre.
m. If the formation lap is started behind the safety car because of heavy rain (see Article 4.8.14(c)), or the race resumed in accordance with Article 4.15.5(a), the use of wet- weather tyres until the safety car returns to the pits is compulsory.
A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who does not use wet weather tyres whilst the safety car is on the track at such times.

"
272,S,2021,Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR),"
The ATR, and the definitions and rules which will apply to aerodynamic testing, are as follows:
9.3.1 General conditions
a. Restricted Aerodynamic testing is the testing by a Competitor or any Associate of a competitor and/or by any contracted party of a competitor or of any Associate of a competitor or any external entity working on behalf of a competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a competitor in a test environment or numerical simulation of a representation of an F1 car or sub-component in order to measure, observe or infer any forces, displacements, pressures or air flow direction resulting directly or indirectly from the incident air flow.
b. The representation of an F1 car or sub-component subject to Restricted Aerodynamic testing, defined either physically or digitally, will be considered for the purposes of this Article as a Restricted Aerodynamic Test Geometry (RATG) and save for where specifically permitted by this Article may not be added to, removed from, morphed or modified. For the avoidance of doubt if the representation contains surfaces that represent more than one F1 car then it shall be construed as the equivalent number of RATGs.
c. An Aerodynamic Testing Period (ATP) is a period of consecutive calendar weeks for the purposes of evaluation of the limits within this Article. As soon as one ATP ends a new one begins, with no gaps between them.
There will be 6 ATPs in any year. The dates of these periods will be as follows:
i. Period 1 will start on 1 January and finish at the end of week 9.
ii. Period 2, 3 and 5 will run for exactly 8 weeks each.
iii. Period 4 will run for 10 weeks, comprising the Summer Factory Shutdown described in Article 9.2
iv. Period 6 will end on the 31 December
For the above definition, weeks are assumed to start on a Monday and week 1 is the first week of four days or more in the calendar year.
d. In the context of this Article the words bodywork, sprung suspension and brake system air ducts will have the same definition as those provided by Article 3 of the F1 Technical Regulations.
Any data acquired during Restricted Aerodynamic testing may only be available to the competitor that acquired it through use of the restricted aerodynamic testing available to it in accordance with the limits in this Article.
"
273,S,2021,Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR),"9.3.2 Restricted Wind Tunnel Testing (RWTT)
RWTT may only be carried out in wind tunnels which have been nominated by the competitor to the FIA. Each competitor may nominate only one wind tunnel for use in any one twelve month period and declare it in writing to the FIA. For a new entrant, the nomination must be made no later than 7 days after the date on which it officially becomes a competitor. No re-nominations may be made for at least 12 months. Nominations should include the facility location, unique identification of the wind tunnel and the scale of model and RATG to be used. The FIA will consider, at its absolute discretion, earlier or temporary nominations if a wind tunnel already
nominated by a team suffers a long term failure or for the purpose of evaluating alternative wind tunnels. If a different facility is to be used or if the existing facility is changed or upgraded, other than for routine maintenance or replacement, then a new declaration must be submitted to the FIA within one month of the change or at the time of submission of a testing period report whichever is earlier.
For the avoidance of doubt, any RWTT carried out on behalf of or for the benefit of the competitor by an Associate, a contracted party of the competitor or of any Associate of the competitor or any external entity working on behalf of the competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a competitor must take place in the wind tunnel nominated by the competitor.
a. The limits for RWTT will be the number of runs of RWTT, the amount of wind tunnel occupancy time and wind tunnel wind-on time.
i. During RWTT a single run will be deemed to commence each time the wind tunnel air speed rises above 5m/s and will end the first time thereafter it falls below 5m/s.
ii. During RWTT, once the wind tunnel air speed rises above 5m/s the RATG must remain fixed and unmodified until the wind tunnel air speed returns below 1m/s.
iii. Between runs of RWTT detail changes to the RATG and model are permitted.
b. Wind on time is defined as the amount of time in hours summed over the ATP, where the wind tunnel air speed exceeds 15m/s for RWTT.
c. During RWTT, the first shift of occupancy will be deemed to commence the first time the wind tunnel air speed is above 5m/s on a given calendar day, and will end at a time, declared by the competitor, when the wind tunnel air speed falls below 5m/s on the same calendar day. A second shift of occupancy will be deemed to commence the first time the wind tunnel air speed is above 5m/s following the end of the first shift of occupancy (on the same calendar day) and will end, either when the wind tunnel air speed falls below 5m/s for the last time on the same calendar day or, at the end of the calendar day in the event a run is still in progress. Only two shifts of occupancy may be carried out in any one calendar day.
d. In the event of a demonstrated wind tunnel failure or other Force Majeure the FIA will consider, at its absolute discretion, permitting additional occupancy to be used to compensate for that which is lost as a result.
e. For the avoidance of doubt any RWTT performed for the competitor by any Associate of the competitor and/or by any contracted party of the competitor or of any Associate of the competitor or any external entity working on behalf of the competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to the competitor during an ATP will be subject to these same limits as if the tests were performed by the competitor.
"
274,S,2021,Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR),"9.3.3 RWTT Permitted technology
The following restrictions apply during RWTT:
a. Only wind tunnels that use air at atmospheric pressure as the test fluid are permitted. Other than rotations of the RATG and model or ground plane about the yaw axis, designs which attempt to create curved flow conditions relative to the RATG are not permitted., For closed section wind tunnels adaption of vertical walls and the ceiling to improve air flow uniformity is permitted.
b. No RWTT may be carried out using a scale model and RATG which is greater than 60% of full size neither may it be carried out at a wind tunnel air speed exceeding 50m/s measured relative to the scale model and RATG. Furthermore, during restricted wind tunnel testing the magnitude of the rate of change of the wind tunnel air speed measured relative to the scale model and RATG must be less than 4.5m/s2. The rate of change of the wind tunnel air speed will be defined as the derivative of wind tunnel air speed and smoothed using a moving
average filter, centred on each sample, of period 0.5 seconds during each wind tunnel air speed ramp up and ramp down phase. These phases are defined as the periods when the wind tunnel air speed is varying between 15m/s and 95% of the maximum wind tunnel air speed during a run.
c. Only one model and RATG may be used per run. A maximum of two models may be used, and a single model change made per Competitor per 24 hour period. For the avoidance of doubt, a model in this context is defined by its underlying spine, motors and sensors.
d. The only permitted degrees of freedom of the model and RATG during a run of RWTT are:
i. Wheel rotation about the wheel axis
ii. Changes of ride height and roll angle relative to the ground plane and associated articulation of the elements representing the RATG suspension
iii. Changes of load applied to wheels through the elements representing the RATG suspension
iv. Steering of the front wheels
v. Changes of yaw angle relative to the incident air flow
vi. Simulation of differing exhaust flow
vii. Adjustment of the flap angle of the front wing
viii. Adjustment of the incidence of the rearmost and uppermost element of the top rear wing
ix. Adjustment or operation of sensors
e. Changes of attitude of the model and RATG may not occur at a rate that requires changes of ride height at the front or rear axle centreline greater than the scale equivalent of 0.033 m/s on the full size F1 car and/or rotation about the yaw or roll axes at a rate greater than 1.0 deg./s.
f. Where non-rigid wind tunnel tyres are used for RWTT these may only be produced by the nominated tyre supplier. Furthermore, devices that actively modify the shape of the tyre during RWTT other than as a result of vertical and lateral loads reacted at the contact patch are not permitted. Tyre pressure control is permitted but the complete wheel must contain only a single fixed internal gas volume.
"
275,S,2021,Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR),"9.3.4 Restricted CFD (RCFD) simulations
RCFDs are Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations by a competitor or any Associate of a competitor and/or by any contracted party of a competitor or of any Associate of a competitor or any external entity working on behalf of a competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a competitor of flows that are gaseous in the case of a F1 car and are not classified as power unit simulations. Any simulation of flows contained within the power unit cooling or lubrication systems, air, air/fuel mixtures, combustion process or products of combustion from a boundary commencing at the power unit’s atmospheric air intake ducts, passing through the power unit and finishing at the exit of the exhaust system will be classified as a power unit simulation.
For the avoidance of doubt, if any CFD simulation (other than the power unit simulation defined above) reveals information to a competitor or to an Associate of the competitor whether directly, via a contracted party or via an external entity working on behalf of a competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a competitor, about flows that are gaseous on a F1 car then it is a RCFD simulation. For example, any CFD simulations conducted at scales other than 1:1 or using non-gaseous fluids are still RCFDs as they reveal information about flows that are gaseous on the full size F1 car.
a. ARCFDsreferstothepre-processing,thesolverpartorpartsofthesimulationprocess, and the post processing of the results of the simulation.
i. Pre-processing refers to the meshing, decomposition and setup of the simulation.
ii. Solver refers to the program or programs that compute the solution of the equations describing the flow including any extension of the simulation or simulations involving additional numerical computation (for example but not limited, to adjoint computation).
iii. Post processing refers to the generation of representations of the flow solution that require numerical processing, for example but not limited to the computation of pressure coefficients, velocity, shear stress, flow streamlines or vorticity. Generation of videos or images displaying this information and any form or application of machine learning, deep learning or artificial intelligence (AI) based on simulation results is included in this definition.
b. During or prior to RCFDs only changes to the attitude of the RATG, (ride height, roll, yaw, steer and associated tyre shape or contact patch) and front wing flap angle or rear wing rearmost and uppermost element incidence are permitted. Modifications to surface and volume mesh resolution and type as well as the extent of the far field domain including changing the simulation between a wind tunnel or track environment, initialisation and boundary conditions are allowed provided none of these are intended to circumvent the requirements of this Article by otherwise creating the effect of a change to the RATG.
The solver part or parts of all RCFDs must only be carried out using a compute resource that contains a set of homogeneous processing units and that has been nominated by the competitor to the FIA. Each competitor must declare to the FIA in writing the compute resources that are employed for the purpose of the solver part or parts of RCFD simulations. Floating, fixed point and integer operations from the solver part or parts of RCFD simulations must only run on and may not be offloaded from these CPU cores.
c. The declaration of a compute resource by the competitor to the FIA must include :
i. The computer or cluster identification, manufacturer, model and location and the manufacturer, name and full unique model number of the Processing Units.
ii. Number of processing unit cores in the compute resource.
iii. Processor speed at which each Processing Unit is configured to run at 100% CPU load (CCF). In order to prevent deliberate underclocking this value may not be lower than the standard or base clock frequency given by the Manufacturer’s specification.
Any specification of compute resource declared must be available on a non-exclusive basis to all competitors.
d. If the compute resource is changed or upgraded then a new declaration must be submitted to the FIA within one month of the change or at the time of submission of a testing period report whichever is earlier. Such changes might include, but are not limited to, a change of the hardware specification, addition or removal of processing units or change of location of any part of the compute resource.
e. The amount of compute resource used for the solve part or parts of all RCFDs shall be measured in Mega Allocation Unit hours (MAUh) and will be calculated as follows.
AUh = (NCU * NSS * CCF) / 3600
Where :
AUh = The total number of Unit hours allocated to a CFD solver run. An Allocation Unit hour represents the use of a unit of resource allocation for one hour (and 1 x
MAUh = 1,000,000 x AUh). An Allocation Unit hour is equivalent to a core hour on a physical CPU core.
CCF = Peak Processing Unit clock frequency in GigaHertz achieved during the CFD solver run. This will be the peak frequency theoretically achievable during the run based on one of the following :
i) The standard or base clock frequency value from the Processing Unit Manufacturer’s specification (if overclocking or enhanced modes are not used in the run).
ii) The maximum “turbo”, “HPC” or other enhanced mode frequency value.
iii) The maximum overclocked frequency value.
NCU = Number of Processing Unit cores used for the solver run. The effects of multi- threading, where simultaneous threads run on the same physical core will be ignored.
NSS = Number of solver wall clock seconds elapsed during the run. Message passing time during calculation must also be included.
All information required for auditing of this calculation must be present in the output from the run including the CCF value.
f. Non-RCFDs can be made by a competitor for the purpose of optimising CFD methodology, provided they use a unique RATG which has been simulated in CFD more than 30 months ago and are carried out using only the nominated compute resources described above. This RATG may not be changed, added to, removed from, morphed or modified. For the avoidance of doubt, any Non-RCFDs carried out on behalf of or for the benefit of the competitor by an Associate, a contracted party of the competitor or of any Associate of the competitor or any external entity working on behalf of the competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a competitor must also be carried out using a unique RATG which has been simulated in CFD by the competitor more than 30 months ago.
g. In the case of Non-RCFDs using a unique RATG which has been simulated in CFD more than 30 months ago geometry manipulations (e.g. in CAD clean-up or meshing software) having the sole purpose of reproducing exactly the same geometry previously solved in CFD (to a tolerance of 1.5mm scaled to a 1:1 car) are allowed. This tolerance is introduced only to allow for unintentional and incidental changes in geometry detail caused by the revisions in software and process. For the avoidance of doubt, static changes to car attitude (ride height, roll, yaw, steer and associated tyre shape or contact patch) and front wing flap angle or rear wing rearmost and uppermost element incidence are permitted. Modifications to surface and volume mesh resolution and type as well as the extent of the far field domain including changing the simulation between a wind tunnel or track environment, are allowed.
h. The limits for RCFDs will be revised periodically, to take account of advances in CFD simulations.

276,S,2021,Exceptions to the Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR),"
a. Any aerodynamic test conducted by an F1 car at any Competition or any aerodynamic test conducted by an F1 car during and at track testing as defined by Article 10 of the F1 Sporting Regulations will not be considered as Restricted Aerodynamic testing.
b. Wind tunnel testing solely for the development of power unit heat exchangers that reject heat to air, or the running of the power unit from a boundary commencing at the power unit air intake ducts, passing through the power unit and finishing at the exit of the exhaust system will not be considered as Restricted Aerodynamic testing, provided that
there is no direct or indirect measurement of aerodynamic force during the test. In this context, pressure and flow measurements within a duct shall not be considered to be measurements of aerodynamic force.
c. Steady state and dynamic engine dynamometer work with an F1 car or subcomponent will not be considered as Restricted Aerodynamic testing provided that :
i. The bodywork used in the test has no front wing assembly (described in Article 3.9 of the F1 Technical Regulations) or rear wing assembly (described in Article 3.10 of the F1 Technical Regulations) present.
ii. No devices designed to measure directly, or indirectly aerodynamic forces or flow field characteristics are installed in the facility used.
iii. No sensor installed on the car or subcomponent which are capable of measuring displacements, pressures or air flow direction of the external airstream resulting directly or indirectly from the incident air flow may be logged. Logging files have to be available, if required, during the independent audit inspection.
iv. The gas flow exiting from the exhaust system is ducted away from the testing area before impacting on any bodywork component (other than the exhaust itself).
d. Wind tunnel testing solely for the development of brake systems, wheels and tyres (Article 11 of the F1 Technical Regulations), and for development and calibration of pressure sensing instrumentation (such as pitot tubes, multi-directional probes and Kiel tubes), provided such tests do not concurrently test, or in any way provide incidental data or knowledge on, the performance or endurance of parts or systems classified as bodywork will not be considered as Restricted Aerodynamic testing.
e. Wind tunnel testing that uses a RATG for the sole purpose of the conditioning of wind tunnel infrastructure or the development of wind tunnel infrastructure (including all of its sub-systems such as rolling road, model motion system, force balance, wind tunnel model spine, sensors etc.) and methodology may be performed and will not count towards the accumulation of runs, wind-on time, and occupancy subject to the testing complying with either of the following restrictions :
i. The front wing group (described in Article 3.9 of the F1 Technical Regulations) and the rear wing group (described in Article 3.10 of the F1 Technical Regulations) of the RATG must be removed from the wind tunnel for the duration of the testing or both must be fitted with bluff covers that have been approved for this purpose by the FIA.
ii. A RATG is used which is more than 12 months old, and that no modification is made to this previously tested RATG.
During audit competitors may be requested to demonstrate compliance of any such testing through the production of supporting data.
For the avoidance of doubt, any wind tunnel testing to develop bodywork parts other than as referred to above even without aerodynamic force measurement is within the definition of Restricted Aerodynamic testing.
"
277,S,2021,Exceptions to the Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR),"9.3.6 Limits, Reporting, Inspection and Audit
a. The limits for RWTT and RCFDs are as set out in the table below:
b. Each competitor shall report to the FIA details of its RWTT and RCFDs for the preceding ATP within 14 days of the end of that ATP. The data must be provided in the exact format specified by the FIA, details of which may be found in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations.
c. Digital wind tunnel image files in colour and with sufficient unobstructed field of view of the wind tunnel working section to include the entire model must be recorded, referenced to other data collected and a copy saved including a unique time stamp to at least one second accuracy for the start of each individual run.
d. Should the FIA wish to access the images for inspection at any time they must be of adequate quality such that it is possible to use them to verify, for example, whether the front wing group (described in Article 3.9 of the F1 Technical Regulations) and rear wing group (described in Article 3.10 of the F1 Technical Regulations) are fitted. In the case of other runs deemed to be non-RWTT in the context of this Article, for example using a RATG greater than 12 months old, or using the approved wing covers, the images must also provide a clear visual reference to assist in verifying this aspect of the test.
e. The complete surface mesh subject to the solver part or parts of each RCFD must be recorded and stored for a period of at least 24 months or until an earlier deletion is agreed by the FIA, referenced to all data relating to the RCFDs including but not limited to solution monitoring data and clearly and uniquely identifiable. It must be possible from these data to verify any changes made to the RCFDs and identify each individual flow solution generated using it.
f. In order to verify the Restricted Aerodynamic testing facilities employed by the competitors and as a means of assuring common application of the restrictions set out in this Article, the FIA will arrange for independent benchmarking inspections of both wind tunnel and CFD activities to be carried out from time to time. Recommendations arising from these inspections will be incorporated into this Article.
g. Failure to comply with the limits of the ATR by a competitor will result in a reduction of the limits that will apply to subsequent ATP or ATPs for that competitor at the FIA’s absolute discretion but by a minimum reduction equivalent to 10 multiples of the amount by which the relevant limit or limits were exceeded without prejudice to further appropriate action. (For example, if a competitor carries out 325 restricted wind tunnel runs against a maximum of 320 in an ATP, that competitor shall only be permitted to make 270 restricted wind tunnel runs during the next ATP).
"
278,S,2021,Exceptions to the Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR),"9.3.7 Movement of personnel
No competitor may use movement of personnel involved in the development, design or testing of aerodynamic surfaces (whether employee, consultant, contractor, secondee or any other type of permanent or temporary personnel) with another competitor, either directly or via an external entity, for the purpose of circumventing the requirements of this Article. In order that the FIA
may be satisfied that any such movement of staff is compliant with this Article, each competitor must inform the FIA of all relevant staff movements at the end of each ATP using the template which may be found in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations and must demonstrate that they have implemented all reasonable measures to avoid the disclosure of information, data or designs between the competitors involved.

"
47,T,2020,"3 BODYWORK AND DIMENSIONS: Definitins, Height and Front Wings","3.3.5 Front wing endplate
A mathematical surface (referred to as the “virtual endplate surface”) must be constructed in order to subsequently define the endplate.
The virtual endplate surface must:
a. Lie entirely between 910mm and 950mm from the car centre plane.
b. Extend forwards, rearwards, upwards and downwards in such way as to intersect respectively the forward, rearward, upper and lower bounding surfaces of the volume defined in Article 3.3.3 over its entire length and height.
c. In no place have a normal which subtends an angle greater than 15° to an axis normal to the car centre plane.
d. Produce one single continuous curve, which is entirely visible from side view, when intersected with any lateral vertical or horizontal plane.
The front wing endplate is defined as the bodywork created by the union of two volumes. The first such volume:
e. Must fully enclose a minimum of 95% of the virtual endplate surface.
f. Over its forward-most 150mm, measured in the longitudinal direction, must in no part be distant more than 10mm from the virtual endplate surface, while over the rest of its volume must in no part be more than 6mm distant from the virtual endplate surface.
g. Is a single volume which contains no apertures and any intersection with any lateral or horizontal plane may only produce a single closed section.
The second such volume:
h. Must have no part which is distant more than 30mm from the virtual endplate surface towards the car centre plane. Any part inboard of the virtual endplate surface must lie in its entirety between 75mm and 85mm above the reference plane.
i. Lies in its entirety between 75mm and 110mm from the reference plane.
j. Is a single volume which contains no apertures or slots.
k. When viewed from below, has a boundary which does not contain any external local concave radius of curvature smaller than 200mm.
Once the two volumes have been defined, a fillet radius of up to 5mm will be permitted where they intersect. Any cross section of the unified volume with a lateral vertical plane should contain only a single closed section.
In order to prevent tyre damage to other cars, the complete endplate, with the exception of parts of the second volume inboard of the virtual endplate surface must be at least 10mm thick (being the minimum distance when measured normal to the surface in any direction) with a 5mm radius applied to all extremities.
In addition, the leading 50mm of this bodywork, with the exception of fasteners and inserts as described below, must be of a prescribed laminate, details of this laminate may be found in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations.
"
48,T,2020,"3 BODYWORK AND DIMENSIONS: Definitins, Height and Front Wings","3.3.6 Front wing profiles
Front wing profiles are defined as bodywork that is contained in the volume which extends from 250mm to 950mm from the car centre plane, and within the volume defined in Article 3.3.3. They must meet the following criteria:
a. Any intersection of these profiles with any longitudinal vertical plane may contain no more than five closed sections, each of which may contain no concave radius of curvature less than 50mm.
b. For the part of the profiles outboard of a plane that lies 400mm from the car centre plane:
i. The rearmost point of every closed section must be visible when viewed from below.
ii. With the exception of the rearmost closed section, the rearmost point of every closed section must not be visible when viewed from above.
iii. The normal to any point of the profiles’ surface must not subtend an angle greater than 15° to a vertical plane which is normal to the diagonal line described in Article 3.3.3(a).
c. Outboard of a plane that lies 400mm from the car centre plane the minimum distance between adjacent sections at any longitudinal vertical plane must lie between 5mm and 15mm at their closest position.
Once the rearmost profile has been defined a single ‘gurney’ type trim tab may be fitted to its trailing edge provided no dimension in a vertical longitudinal section exceeds 10mm. This part must comply with the constraints of Article 3.3.6 (b) (iii), with the exception of its innermost and outermost 10mm (measured in a direction normal to the car centre plane) where these constraints do not apply. For clarity, gurneys that overlap with the adjustable and non- adjustable portion of the profiles (as described in Article 3.3.7) will be considered to be a single gurney, provided they satisfy all of the above criteria in the design position of the profiles.
Minimal exceptions to the above geometrical criteria can occur in areas of transition close to consecutive longitudinal vertical cross sections with a different number of individual profiles. Outboard of a longitudinal plane that lies 400mm from the car centre plane, such changes may only be achieved by the bifurcation of a single closed section into two or more closed sections, and the method of construction of this transition is detailed below.
The area of transition will be defined by two vertical planes, which are parallel to each other, up to 20mm apart, and form an angle of no more than 20° to the car centre plane. Within this area:
d. The inboard (single) profile surface must be defined over the full span of the transition area in full compliance with Article 3.3.6.
e. The outboard profile (two or more) surfaces must be defined over the full span of the transition area in full compliance with Article 3.3.6, lie entirely within the single profile surface, and share the same overall chord.
f. Once the inboard and outboard profile surfaces have been defined, blending surfaces must be defined to join the profiles together. These surfaces must lie within the volume of the single, inboard profile surface, and entirely within the transition volume. Once these minimal transition surfaces have been defined, the original overlapping surfaces of the inboard and outboard profiles must be trimmed accordingly.
The construction method described above may also be used to define the transition outboard of the single section defined by Article 3.3.1 and the sections that lie outboard of it. For the avoidance of doubt, these transition surfaces must lie entirely outboard of a vertical longitudinal plane that lies 250mm from the car centre plane.
Once the front wing profiles have been defined, they must be trimmed by the virtual endplate surface defined in Article 3.3.5, and the portion of the front wing profiles outboard of that surface must be discarded. Where the front wing profiles intersect the front wing endplate, a maximum fillet radius of 10mm may be applied.
"
49,T,2020,"3 BODYWORK AND DIMENSIONS: Definitins, Height and Front Wings","3.3.7 Adjustability of front wing
Once the Front Wing Profiles have been defined in accordance with Article 3.3.6, a portion of up to four of the rearmost profiles and the gurney, may be adjustable in order to trim the front wing aerodynamic load.
For this purpose:
a. The parts of the front wing profiles that are included within the adjustable part must have no degrees of freedom between them.
b. The adjustment may only be a rotation about a fixed axis. In plan view, this axis must not subtend an angle greater than 20deg to the diagonal line described in Article 3.3.3 (a), and in front view it must not subtend an angle greater than 15deg to the horizontal plane. For the full extent of the adjustable part of the profiles outboard of a plane that lies 400mm from the car centre plane, and in any longitudinal vertical plane, this axis must lie between two vertical lines, one that passes through the forward most point of the adjustable part of the profiles in that section, and another one 30mm behind the first line.
c. The junction between the adjustable and non-adjustable parts of the profiles must be defined by one or two surfaces of revolution about the fixed axis of rotation defined in 3.3.7 b . Furthermore, any normal to these surfaces of revolution may not subtend an angle greater than 55° to a line that is normal to the car centre plane. These surfaces of revolution must also lie inboard of the virtual endplate surface defined in Article 3.3.5.
d. The original position of these profiles (as defined in accordance with Article 3.3.6) must be included within the overall range of adjustment. Furthermore, the maximum deviation for any point of these profiles between the uppermost and lowermost angle of adjustment must not exceed 35mm.
e. Minimal exceptions to the geometrical criteria of Article 3.3.6 for the wing profiles may be made in the junction between the adjustable and non-adjustable parts, in order to ensure the necessary level of sealing. Such parts must lie within 3mm from one of the two surfaces of revolution and their maximum size must be the minimum necessary amount required to achieve a 20mm overlap between the adjustable and the non-adjustable parts of the profiles over the whole range of movement.
For the avoidance of doubt, the adjustment permitted under this Article is only allowed when the car is stationary and by the use of a tool, and in accordance with the Formula 1 Sporting Regulations.
Furthermore, any such variation of incidence maintains compliance with all of the bodywork regulations, with the exception of Articles 3.3.6 (a) and 3.3.6 (b).
"
50,T,2020,"3 BODYWORK AND DIMENSIONS: Definitins, Height and Front Wings","3.3.8 Front wing strakes
Strakes may be constructed once the front wing profiles have been defined. For each strake, a virtual strake surface must be first defined, which must:
a. Be connected to the non-adjustable part of the front wing profiles.
b. Lie in its entirety between two vertical longitudinal planes, 20mm apart, and between 500mm and 800mm from the car centre plane.
c. Lie entirely between 75mm and 150mm from the reference plane.
d. Not be closer than 50mm in any point to the other such virtual strake surface.
e. In no place have a normal which subtends an angle greater than 10° to an axis normal to the car centre plane.
f. Contain no more than one curve when intersected by any lateral vertical or horizontal plane. In side view, no part of the virtual strake surface may obstruct any other part of it.
Once the virtual strake surface has been defined, the strake itself must:
g. Fully enclose the entire virtual strake surface.
h. In no part lie vertically above the upper surface of the front wing profiles defined in Article 3.3.6.
i. Be no more than 6mm distant from the virtual strake surface, except its rear-most 100mm (measured in the longitudinal direction), where this maximum distance must not exceed 3mm.
Once the actual strake volume has been defined, a fillet radius of up to 5mm will be permitted where this strake volume intersects the individual profiles described in Article 3.3.6.

a. Two brackets which define the pivot axis of the adjustable part of the front wing profile, and allow the necessary movement. These brackets must:
i. be in their entirety within 40mm from both the stationary and the adjustable part of the profiles over the whole range of adjustment
ii. be no more than 5mm thick. A fillet radius no greater than 2mm will be permitted where these brackets join the two profiles
iii. have no dimension that exceeds 80mm
b. Up to sixteen (in total, per side) slot gap separator brackets which connect consecutive front wing profiles. These brackets must:
i. be in their entirety within 30mm from both of the two profiles they support in relation to each other
ii. be no more than 5mm thick. A fillet radius no greater than 2mm will be permitted where these brackets join the two profiles
iii. have no dimension that exceeds 60mm
c. A mechanism with or without a fairing to contain it for the angle adjustment of part of the front wing profiles, as defined in Article 3.3.7. This mechanism and fairing must fit within a cuboid of which is 25mm wide, 60mm long and 60mm high. This cuboid may have a free orientation in space, but must intersect both the stationary and the adjustable part of the profiles for the entire range of adjustment.
d. A fairing that contains a single tyre temperature sensor. The entire fairing and sensor must:
i. fit in the union between two volumes, a cuboid which is 15mm wide, 60mm long and 50mm high and a circular cylinder which has a base diameter of 30mm and a height of 60mm. The axis of the cylinder must coincide with the major axis of the one of the 15mm x 60mm faces of the cuboid.
ii. be symmetrical about a plane which is parallel to the 50mm x 60mm faces of the cuboid, and
iii. intersect either the profiles defined in Article 3.3.6 or the endplate defined in Article 3.3.5. A fillet radius no greater than 5mm will be permitted along the periphery of this intersection.
Furthermore, all the components listed above must not be visible from below, with the front wing endplates defined in Article 3.3.5 and the front wing strakes defined in Article 3.3.8 removed, and must lie inboard of the virtual endplate surface defined in Article 3.3.5.
Should there be a requirement for any additional component to be added, a team must write specifically to the FIA with an explanation, design, and calculated aerodynamic effect, in order to get approval. Such a communication will be circulated to rival teams if deemed to cover a new aspect that had previously not been considered.

a. There should be a maximum of two, mounted on the steering wheel for direct access in all circumstances.
b. They should be of pull-type, opening the clutch when pulling the paddle towards the driver.
c. Their travel should be in a plane nominally normal to the face of the steering wheel, with a maximum displacement of the driver’s contact surfaces of 80mm between end stops.
d. They should have only a single degree of freedom.
e. Where two paddles are fitted, they must be a left and right handed pair, identical in function and ergonomics, mounted in a symmetrically opposite manner on either side of the steering wheel centre plane. For the avoidance of doubt, they must have the same mechanical travel characteristics and be mapped identically.
No interaction between them or the associated FIA ECU inputs will be permitted and, furthermore, competitors must be able to demonstrate beyond any doubt that each of the paddles may only be operated with only one hand.
f. To ensure that the signals used by the FIA ECU are representative of the driver’s actions, each competitor is required to demonstrate that the paddle percentage calculated by the ECU does not deviate by more than +/-5% from the physical position of the operating device measured as a percentage over its entire usable range.
In that context, the physical position of the paddle will be measured at the location operated by the fingers.
"
267,T,2020,Clutch control,"9.2.2 Designs which allow specific points along the travel range of the clutch operating device to be identified by the driver or assist him to hold a position are not permitted.
In order to prevent interaction between the clutch paddles and other driver control devices, at least one of the following arrangements must be respected:
a. When pulled to its maximum travel position, any clutch paddle should not reach further than the driver’s contact surfaces of any other paddle, lever or switch in any of their positions.
b. The outboard 60% portion of any clutch paddle, measured from its mounting point to its outer edge by the driver’s contact surface, should be a minimum of 50mm away over its entire travel range from any other paddle, lever or switch.
c. A clutch paddle should be separated from any adjacent paddle, lever or switch by a physical stop preventing any practical interaction between them by the driver. Such stop should be sized and shaped so that it cannot be used as a reference point during paddle operation.
In addition, other parts of the steering wheel or chassis should not be practically usable as reference points for the driver to identify or hold a specific position.
"
268,T,2020,Clutch control,"9.2.3 The minimum and maximum travel positions of the clutch operating device must correspond to the clutch fully engaged normal rest position and fully disengaged (incapable of transmitting any useable torque) positions respectively.
"

d. De-clutch protections
e. Drivetrain protection on the track outside of any start lockout period or immediately following stall prevention activation only
f. Test signals enabled only when the car is connected to the garage system.
When commanded by the driver, the amount of clutch engagement will be expressed in the FIA ECU as torque at the rear axle by applying a gain of 4500Nm / 90% to the clutch paddle position between 5% and 95%.
In that case the clutch torque controller implemented in the FIA ECU must be used. Except for the first 70ms following the initial step in clutch torque demand during a launch, the control error, calculated using the power unit output shaft torque sensor, must be contained in a band of +/-150Nm when converted at the rear axle.
"
271,T,2020,Clutch control,"9.2.6 When the clutch operating device is released from its maximum travel position it must return to its resting position within 50ms.
The maximum delay allowed, computed from the respective signals as recorded by the ADR or ECU, between the clutch driver control input signal and the corresponding output demand being achieved is 50ms.
"
272,T,2020,Clutch control,"9.2.7 Any device or system which notifies the driver of the amount of clutch slip or engagement is not permitted.
"
273,T,2020,traction control,"
No car may be equipped with a system or device which is capable of preventing the driven wheels from spinning under power or of compensating for excessive torque demand by the driver.
Any device or system which notifies the driver of the onset of wheel spin is not permitted.
"
274,T,2020,9.4 Clutch disengagement,"
All cars must be fitted with a means of disengaging the clutch for a minimum of fifteen minutes in the event of the car coming to rest with the engine stopped. This system must be in working order throughout the Event even if the main hydraulic, pneumatic or electrical systems on the car have failed. This system must also disconnect any ERS system fitted to the car.
In order that the driver or a marshal may activate the system in less than five seconds, the switch or button which operates it must :

b. The clutch actuator and clutch release bearing(s).
c. Inboard driveshaft joints and seals but not their housing if that housing is integral with the gearbox output shaft and therefore part of the sprung mass.
d. The hydraulic system prior to the point at which it produces direct mechanical movement of the gear selection mechanism by means of hydraulic actuator(s).

Furthermore, when viewed from the side, the lowest and highest points of the impact absorbing structure between its rear face and 50mm aft of the rear wheel centre line may not be separated vertically by more than 275 mm.
Between the rear face and the rear wheel centre line no dimension of the area thus defined may diminish nor may any part of the structure or gearbox which is visible from below, other than the permitted radii, be higher than the lower edge of the rear face. Pockets of minimum
size within the structure are permitted for the sole purpose of attaching suspension members.
This structure must pass an impact test and must be constructed from materials which will not be substantially affected by the temperatures it is likely to be subjected to during use. Details of the test procedure may be found in Article 16.4.
In order to minimise the likelihood of the structure penetrating a survival cell, it must be designed so that the majority of its material lies evenly around its perimeter. Therefore, the perimeter of every vertical cross section between points 50mm forward of its rear face and 200mm forward of its rear face must be of a uniform construction and, with the exception of minimal local changes for attachments, have a minimum thickness of 1.75mm. Material with a specific gravity of less than 1 will not be considered when calculating these thicknesses and, furthermore, any internal structure must not be thicker than any part of the perimeter at that section.
Only those parts of the structure which genuinely contribute to its performance during the impact test, and which are designed and fitted for that sole purpose, will be considered when assessing compliance with any of the above.

a. Minimal changes for safety, reliability or cost reasons.
b. Changes for driver comfort, or for the installation of a new driver. For the avoidance of doubt, changes which are intended to improve the functionality of the driver will not be accepted (e.g. new switch layout to increase the number of available options).
c. Changes of supplier, if the existing HC supplier is unable to continue the supply of a component or sub-assembly. In such cases, the specification of the new component or sub-assembly must be as close as possible to that of the component or sub- assembly it replaces.
d. Changes due to regulation changes, legality fixes or the installation of FIA-mandated components.
e. Minimal setup options of parts of the HC. Such options may include, but are not limited to washers, spacers, spring stiffness, brackets, etc. In any case the FIA must be satisfied that these setup options do not constitute a fundamentally new design or specification of the HC.
f. Minimal modifications that can be applied onto a finished HC of the original design specification. Such modifications may include, but are not limited to, minor local machining, the drilling of a hole, or minor local reinforcement, which in the opinion of the FIA do not have a significant cost or functionality implication.
In such cases, the modified HC must have no performance or weight improvement in comparison to the component or assembly it replaces.
In all cases, the Competitor must seek the approval of the FIA with full details of the planned modification. The FIA must be fully satisfied that the reasons of the suggested modification are the ones claimed by the Competitor, and that such modifications are consistent with the intent of this Article, before granting their permission for the suggested modifications.

- D1: notify the FIA of the intent to modify an HC, with an estimate on the parts it affects and a brief description of the reasons
- D2: provide the FIA with a full specification of the intended changes of the HC and any affected components
- D3: provide the FIA with a detailed scheme of the intended changes
For all three deadlines, the FIA will undertake to respond to the Competitor within a week in relation to the proposed modification.
The following table shows the deadlines of these three dates in accordance to the HC that is getting modified:
The following further provisions apply in relation to HCs modified using the token system defined in this Article:
a. Minor consequential changes to adjacent components will be accepted with the approval of the FIA.
b. Following a declaration within the set time scales, should the Competitor wish to abandon the related project, it will not be possible to re-use the tokens for other purposes.
c. In the case an HC component has been revised either through the use of tokens, or before its homologation date but does not meet the Competitors expectations, it will be permitted to revert back to the original specification of this HC component within five Competitions from its first introduction. Any tokens used may not be re-used for other purposes, and the new specification must be discarded.

48,T,2021,2 GENERAL PRINCIPLES,"2.5 New systems or technologies
Any new system, procedure or technology not specifically covered by these regulations, but which is deemed permissible by the FIA Formula One Technical Department, will only be admitted until the end of the Championship during which it is introduced. Following this the Formula One Commission will be asked to review the technology concerned and, if they feel it adds no value to Formula One in general, it will be specifically prohibited.
Any team whose technology is prohibited in this way will then be required to publish full technical details of the relevant system or procedure.
"
49,T,2021,2 GENERAL PRINCIPLES,"2.6 Measurements
All measurements must be made while the car is stationary on a flat horizontal surface.
"
50,T,2021,2 GENERAL PRINCIPLES,"2.7 Duty of Competitor
It is the duty of each competitor to satisfy the FIA technical delegate and the stewards that his automobile complies with these regulations in their entirety at all times during an Event.
The design of the car, its components and systems shall, with the exception of safety features, demonstrate their compliance with these regulations by means of physical inspection of hardware or materials. No mechanical design may rely upon software inspection as a means of ensuring its compliance.
Due to their nature, the compliance of electronic systems may be assessed by means of inspection of hardware, software and data.
CAD models may be requested by the FIA in order to check compliance with the Regulations. Such models should be supplied in a format and by a method specified by the FIA. In such cases, scanning technology will be used by the FIA to check that the physical car is the same as the inspected CAD models.
Each competitor must ensure that all relevant personnel (whether employee, consultant, contractor, secondee or any other type of permanent or temporary personnel) associated with its participation in the Championship are appropriately informed with respect to the ways in which their areas of responsibility may impact the competitor’s compliance with the Regulations.
Each competitor must ensure that the FIA ethics and compliance hotline with respect to the Regulations is clearly communicated to all these individuals."

"
57,T,2021,"3 BODYWORK AND DIMENSIONS: Definitins, Height and Front Wings","3.3.5 Front wing endplate
A mathematical surface (referred to as the “virtual endplate surface”) must be constructed in order to subsequently define the endplate.
The virtual endplate surface must:
a. Lie entirely between 910mm and 950mm from the car centre plane.
b. Extend forwards, rearwards, upwards and downwards in such way as to intersect respectively the forward, rearward, upper and lower bounding surfaces of the volume defined in Article 3.3.3 over its entire length and height.
c. In no place have a normal which subtends an angle greater than 15° to an axis normal to the car centre plane.
d. Produce one single continuous curve, which is entirely visible from side view, when intersected with any lateral vertical or horizontal plane.
The front wing endplate is defined as the bodywork created by the union of two volumes. The first such volume:
e. Must fully enclose a minimum of 95% of the virtual endplate surface.
f. Over its forward-most 150mm, measured in the longitudinal direction, must in no part be distant more than 10mm from the virtual endplate surface, while over the rest of its volume must in no part be more than 6mm distant from the virtual endplate surface.
g. Is a single volume which contains no apertures and any intersection with any lateral or horizontal plane may only produce a single closed section.
The second such volume:
h. Must have no part which is distant more than 30mm from the virtual endplate surface towards the car centre plane. Any part inboard of the virtual endplate surface must lie in its entirety between 75mm and 85mm above the reference plane.
i. Lies in its entirety between 75mm and 110mm from the reference plane.
j. Is a single volume which contains no apertures or slots.
k. When viewed from below, has a boundary which does not contain any external local concave radius of curvature smaller than 200mm.
Once the two volumes have been defined, a fillet radius of up to 5mm will be permitted where they intersect. Any cross section of the unified volume with a lateral vertical plane should contain only a single closed section.
In order to prevent tyre damage to other cars, the complete endplate, with the exception of parts of the second volume inboard of the virtual endplate surface must be at least 10mm thick (being the minimum distance when measured normal to the surface in any direction) with a 5mm radius applied to all extremities.
In addition, the leading 50mm of this bodywork, with the exception of fasteners and inserts as described below, must be of a prescribed laminate, details of this laminate may be found in the Appendix to the Technical Regulations.
Fasteners and related inserts, for the purpose of attaching the front wing endplate to the profiles must be positioned at least 30mm rearward of the leading edge of the endplate.
"
58,T,2021,"3 BODYWORK AND DIMENSIONS: Definitins, Height and Front Wings","3.3.6 Front wing profiles
Front wing profiles are defined as bodywork that is contained in the volume which extends from 250mm to 950mm from the car centre plane, and within the volume defined in Article 3.3.3. They must meet the following criteria:
a. Any intersection of these profiles with any longitudinal vertical plane may contain no more than five closed sections, each of which may contain no concave radius of curvature less than 50mm.
b. For the part of the profiles outboard of a plane that lies 400mm from the car centre plane:
i. The rearmost point of every closed section must be visible when viewed from below.
ii. With the exception of the rearmost closed section, the rearmost point of every closed section must not be visible when viewed from above.
iii. The normal to any point of the profiles’ surface must not subtend an angle greater than 15° to a vertical plane which is normal to the diagonal line described in Article 3.3.3(a).
c. Outboard of a plane that lies 400mm from the car centre plane the minimum distance between adjacent sections at any longitudinal vertical plane must lie between 5mm and 15mm at their closest position.
Once the rearmost profile has been defined a single ‘gurney’ type trim tab may be fitted to its trailing edge provided no dimension in a vertical longitudinal section exceeds 10mm. This part must comply with the constraints of Article 3.3.6 (b) (iii), with the exception of its innermost and outermost 10mm (measured in a direction normal to the car centre plane) where these constraints do not apply. For clarity, gurneys that overlap with the adjustable and non- adjustable portion of the profiles (as described in Article 3.3.7) will be considered to be a single gurney, provided they satisfy all of the above criteria in the design position of the profiles.
Minimal exceptions to the above geometrical criteria can occur in areas of transition close to consecutive longitudinal vertical cross sections with a different number of individual profiles. Outboard of a longitudinal plane that lies 400mm from the car centre plane, such changes may only be achieved by the bifurcation of a single closed section into two or more closed sections, and the method of construction of this transition is detailed below.
The area of transition will be defined by two vertical planes, which are parallel to each other, up to 20mm apart, and form an angle of no more than 20° to the car centre plane. Within this area:
d. The inboard (single) profile surface must be defined over the full span of the transition area in full compliance with Article 3.3.6.
e. The outboard profile (two or more) surfaces must be defined over the full span of the transition area in full compliance with Article 3.3.6, lie entirely within the single profile surface, and share the same overall chord.
f. Once the inboard and outboard profile surfaces have been defined, blending surfaces must be defined to join the profiles together. These surfaces must lie within the volume of the single, inboard profile surface, and entirely within the transition volume. Once these minimal transition surfaces have been defined, the original overlapping surfaces of the inboard and outboard profiles must be trimmed accordingly.
The construction method described above may also be used to define the transition outboard of the single section defined by Article 3.3.1 and the sections that lie outboard of it. For the avoidance of doubt, these transition surfaces must lie entirely outboard of a vertical longitudinal plane that lies 250mm from the car centre plane.
Once the front wing profiles have been defined, they must be trimmed by the virtual endplate surface defined in Article 3.3.5, and the portion of the front wing profiles outboard of that surface must be discarded. Where the front wing profiles intersect the front wing endplate, a maximum fillet radius of 10mm may be applied.
"
59,T,2021,"3 BODYWORK AND DIMENSIONS: Definitins, Height and Front Wings","3.3.7 Adjustability of front wing
Once the Front Wing Profiles have been defined in accordance with Article 3.3.6, a portion of up to four of the rearmost profiles and the gurney, may be adjustable in order to trim the front wing aerodynamic load.
For this purpose:
a. The parts of the front wing profiles that are included within the adjustable part must have no degrees of freedom between them.
b. The adjustment may only be a rotation about a fixed axis. In plan view, this axis must not subtend an angle greater than 20deg to the diagonal line described in Article 3.3.3 (a), and in front view it must not subtend an angle greater than 15deg to the horizontal plane. For the full extent of the adjustable part of the profiles outboard of a plane that lies 400mm from the car centre plane, and in any longitudinal vertical plane, this axis must lie between two vertical lines, one that passes through the forward most point of the adjustable part of the profiles in that section, and another one 30mm behind the first line.
c. The junction between the adjustable and non-adjustable parts of the profiles must be defined by one or two surfaces of revolution about the fixed axis of rotation defined in 3.3.7 b . Furthermore, any normal to these surfaces of revolution may not subtend an angle greater than 55° to a line that is normal to the car centre plane. These surfaces of revolution must also lie inboard of the virtual endplate surface defined in Article 3.3.5.
d. The original position of these profiles (as defined in accordance with Article 3.3.6) must be included within the overall range of adjustment. Furthermore, the maximum deviation for any point of these profiles between the uppermost and lowermost angle of adjustment must not exceed 35mm.
e. Minimal exceptions to the geometrical criteria of Article 3.3.6 for the wing profiles may be made in the junction between the adjustable and non-adjustable parts, in order to ensure the necessary level of sealing. Such parts must lie within 3mm from one of the two surfaces of revolution and their maximum size must be the minimum necessary amount required to achieve a 20mm overlap between the adjustable and the non-adjustable parts of the profiles over the whole range of movement.
For the avoidance of doubt, the adjustment permitted under this Article is only allowed when the car is stationary and by the use of a tool, and in accordance with the Formula 1 Sporting Regulations.
Furthermore, any such variation of incidence maintains compliance with all of the bodywork regulations, with the exception of Articles 3.3.6 (a) and 3.3.6 (b).
"
60,T,2021,"3 BODYWORK AND DIMENSIONS: Definitins, Height and Front Wings","3.3.8 Front wing strakes
Strakes may be constructed once the front wing profiles have been defined. For each strake, a virtual strake surface must be first defined, which must:
a. Be connected to the non-adjustable part of the front wing profiles.
b. Lie in its entirety between two vertical longitudinal planes, 20mm apart, and between 500mm and 800mm from the car centre plane.
c. Lie entirely between 75mm and 150mm from the reference plane.
d. Not be closer than 50mm in any point to the other such virtual strake surface.
e. In no place have a normal which subtends an angle greater than 10° to an axis normal to the car centre plane.
f. Contain no more than one curve when intersected by any lateral vertical or horizontal plane. In side view, no part of the virtual strake surface may obstruct any other part of it.
Once the virtual strake surface has been defined, the strake itself must:
g. Fully enclose the entire virtual strake surface.
h. In no part lie vertically above the upper surface of the front wing profiles defined in Article 3.3.6.
i. Be no more than 6mm distant from the virtual strake surface, except its rear-most 100mm (measured in the longitudinal direction), where this maximum distance must not exceed 3mm.
Once the actual strake volume has been defined, a fillet radius of up to 5mm will be permitted where this strake volume intersects the individual profiles described in Article 3.3.6.

a. Two brackets which define the pivot axis of the adjustable part of the front wing profile, and allow the necessary movement. These brackets must:
i. be in their entirety within 40mm from both the stationary and the adjustable part of the profiles over the whole range of adjustment
ii. be no more than 5mm thick. A fillet radius no greater than 2mm will be permitted where these brackets join the two profiles
iii. have no dimension that exceeds 80mm
b. Up to sixteen (in total, per side) slot gap separator brackets which connect consecutive front wing profiles. These brackets must:
i. be in their entirety within 30mm from both of the two profiles they support in relation to each other
ii. be no more than 5mm thick. A fillet radius no greater than 2mm will be permitted where these brackets join the two profiles
iii. have no dimension that exceeds 60mm
c. A mechanism with or without a fairing to contain it for the angle adjustment of part of the front wing profiles, as defined in Article 3.3.7. This mechanism and fairing must fit within a cuboid of which is 25mm wide, 60mm long and 60mm high. This cuboid may have a free orientation in space, but must intersect both the stationary and the adjustable part of the profiles for the entire range of adjustment.
d. A fairing that contains a single tyre temperature sensor. The entire fairing and sensor must:
i. fit in the union between two volumes, a cuboid which is 15mm wide, 60mm long and 50mm high and a circular cylinder which has a base diameter of 30mm and a height of 60mm. The axis of the cylinder must coincide with the major axis of the one of the 15mm x 60mm faces of the cuboid.
ii. be symmetrical about a plane which is parallel to the 50mm x 60mm faces of the cuboid, and
iii. intersect either the profiles defined in Article 3.3.6 or the endplate defined in Article 3.3.5. A fillet radius no greater than 5mm will be permitted along the periphery of this intersection.
Furthermore, all the components listed above must not be visible from below, with the front wing endplates defined in Article 3.3.5 and the front wing strakes defined in Article 3.3.8 removed, and must lie inboard of the virtual endplate surface defined in Article 3.3.5.
Should there be a requirement for any additional component to be added, a team must write specifically to the FIA with an explanation, design, and calculated aerodynamic effect, in order to get approval. Such a communication will be circulated to rival teams if deemed to cover a new aspect that had previously not been considered.

"
281,T,2021,Transmission types,"No transmission system may permit more than two wheels to be driven.
"
282,T,2021,Clutch control,"

The following applies only to the main drivetrain clutch or clutches, any clutch used exclusively as part of an ERS is exempt.
9.2.1 Clutch operating devices must be in the form of paddles, which comply with the following principles:
a. There should be a maximum of two, mounted on the steering wheel for direct access in all circumstances.
b. They should be of pull-type, opening the clutch when pulling the paddle towards the driver.
c. Their travel should be in a plane nominally normal to the face of the steering wheel, with a maximum displacement of the driver’s contact surfaces of 80mm between end stops.
d. They should have only a single degree of freedom.
e. Where two paddles are fitted, they must be a left and right handed pair, identical in function and ergonomics, mounted in a symmetrically opposite manner on either side of the steering wheel centre plane. For the avoidance of doubt, they must have the same mechanical travel characteristics and be mapped identically.
No interaction between them or the associated FIA ECU inputs will be permitted and, furthermore, competitors must be able to demonstrate beyond any doubt that each of the paddles may only be operated with only one hand.
f. To ensure that the signals used by the FIA ECU are representative of the driver’s actions, each competitor is required to demonstrate that the paddle percentage calculated by the ECU does not deviate by more than +/-5% from the physical position of the operating device measured as a percentage over its entire usable range.
In that context, the physical position of the paddle will be measured at the location operated by the fingers.
"
283,T,2021,Clutch control,"9.2.2 Designs which allow specific points along the travel range of the clutch operating device to be identified by the driver or assist him to hold a position are not permitted.
In order to prevent interaction between the clutch paddles and other driver control devices, at least one of the following arrangements must be respected:
a. When pulled to its maximum travel position, any clutch paddle should not reach further than the driver’s contact surfaces of any other paddle, lever or switch in any of their positions.
b. The outboard 60% portion of any clutch paddle, measured from its mounting point to its outer edge by the driver’s contact surface, should be a minimum of 50mm away over its entire travel range from any other paddle, lever or switch.
c. A clutch paddle should be separated from any adjacent paddle, lever or switch by a physical stop preventing any practical interaction between them by the driver. Such stop should be sized and shaped so that it cannot be used as a reference point during paddle operation.
In addition, other parts of the steering wheel or chassis should not be practically usable as reference points for the driver to identify or hold a specific position.
"
284,T,2021,Clutch control,"9.2.3 The minimum and maximum travel positions of the clutch operating device must correspond to the clutch fully engaged normal rest position and fully disengaged (incapable of transmitting any useable torque) positions respectively.
"
285,T,2021,Clutch control,"9.2.4 Designs or systems which in addition to typical inherent hydraulic and mechanical properties are designed to, or have the effect of, adjusting or otherwise influencing the amount, or rate, of engagement being demanded by the FIA ECU, are not permitted.
"
286,T,2021,Clutch control,"9.2.5 The amount by which the clutch is engaged must be controlled solely and directly by the driver with the exception of :

d. De-clutch protections
e. Drivetrain protection on the track outside of any start lockout period or immediately following stall prevention activation only
f. Test signals enabled only when the car is connected to the garage system.
When commanded by the driver, the amount of clutch engagement will be expressed in the FIA ECU as torque at the rear axle by applying a gain of 4500Nm / 90% to the clutch paddle position between 5% and 95%.
In that case the clutch torque controller implemented in the FIA ECU must be used. Except for the first 70ms following the initial step in clutch torque demand during a launch, the control error, calculated using the power unit output shaft torque sensor, must be contained in a band of +/-150Nm when converted at the rear axle.
"
287,T,2021,Clutch control,"9.2.6 When the clutch operating device is released from its maximum travel position it must return to its resting position within 50ms.
The maximum delay allowed, computed from the respective signals as recorded by the ADR or ECU, between the clutch driver control input signal and the corresponding output demand being achieved is 50ms.
"
288,T,2021,Clutch control,"9.2.7 Any device or system which notifies the driver of the amount of clutch slip or engagement is not permitted.
"
289,T,2021,traction control,"
No car may be equipped with a system or device which is capable of preventing the driven wheels from spinning under power or of compensating for excessive torque demand by the driver.
Any device or system which notifies the driver of the onset of wheel spin is not permitted.
"
290,T,2021,9.4 Clutch disengagement,"
All cars must be fitted with a means of disengaging the clutch for a minimum of fifteen minutes in the event of the car coming to rest with the engine stopped. This system must be in working order throughout the Event even if the main hydraulic, pneumatic or electrical systems on the car have failed.

"
292,T,2021,Gearboxes,"9.5.2 In this context the following parts are not considered part of the gearbox and may be changed without incurring a penalty under the F1 Sporting Regulations. If changing any of these parts involves breaking an FIA applied seal this may be done but must be carried out
under FIA supervision :

One gear change is permitted after the race has started and before the car speed has reached 80km/h, provided every gear fitted to the car is capable of achieving at least 80km/h at 15,000rpm.
"
301,T,2021,9.8 Gear changing,"9.8.3 The minimum possible gear the driver is able to select must remain fixed whilst the car is moving.
Each individual gear change must be separately initiated by the driver and, within the mechanical constraints of the gearbox; the requested gear must be engaged immediately unless over-rev protection is used to reject the gear shift request. Once a gear change request has been accepted no further requests may be accepted until the first gear change has been completed.
Multiple gear changes may only be made under Article 5.21 or when a shift to gearbox neutral is made following a request from the driver.
If an over-rev protection strategy is used this may only prevent engagement of the target gear, it must not induce a delay greater than 50ms. If a gear change is refused in this way, engagement may only follow a new and separate request made by the driver.
Any de-bounce time used to condition driver gear change requests must be fixed.
"
302,T,2021,9.8 Gear changing,"9.8.4 The maximum permitted duration for down changes and up changes is 300ms and 200ms respectively. The maximum permitted delay for the latter is 80ms from the time of the driver request to the original gear being disengaged.

"
482,T,2021,22.2 General Principles,"
22.2.1 Classification:
a. Subject to Article 22.2.1 (d), all components used in Formula One cars and all equipment used to support a Competitor’s operations during a Championship shall be classified as a Listed Team Component (LTC), or a Standard Supply Component (SSC), or a Prescribed Design Component (PDC), or a Transferable Component (TRC), or a Free Supply Component (FSC), or an Open Source Component (OSC), each as defined in Article 22.3-22.7 (inclusive).
b. Unless otherwise specified, such components/equipment will be classified as FSC for 2021 and LTC from 2022 onwards.
c. All Aerodynamic Components described in Article 3 or Articles 11.4, 11.5 and 11.6 of these Technical Regulations are LTC, unless specifically defined as PDC or OSC.
d. Power Unit components shown in the column “Definitions” of the table in Appendix 2 of the Technical Regulations do not fall under any of the six categories set out in this Article.
e. For 2021, a number of components will be homologated and remain unchanged from a specific moment in time. Full details about these components can be found in Article 22.8.
f. In cases of doubt, the FIA should be consulted and shall determine the classification of the particular component or piece of equipment, should that differ from the default classification mentioned in Article 22.2.1(b) above.
22.2.2 For the purposes of the remaining provisions of this Article 22, any reference to any Competitor shall include (a) any Associate of such Competitor; and (b) any external entity (i) working on behalf of a Competitor or (ii) working for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor.
22.2.3 For the purposes of the remaining provisions of this Article 22, any reference to a “component” may also refer to complete assemblies.
22.2.4 No Competitor may use movement of personnel (whether employee, consultant, contractor, secondee or any other type of permanent or temporary personnel) with another Competitor, either directly or via an external entity, for the purpose of circumventing the requirements of this Article 22.
22.2.5 From time to time the FIA may request that a competitor shares certain information in connection with this Article 22 with the FIA (a) so that the FIA may share with the other competitors for safety reasons only, or (b) to assist the FIA in considering future amendments to the Technical Regulations, subject in each case to receiving the appropriate undertaking of confidentiality from the FIA.
22.2.6 Except as otherwise expressly permitted by these Technical Regulations or by the FIA, no competitor may directly or indirectly disclose or transfer any Intellectual Property to another competitor that is reasonably likely to impact upon the performance of the receiving competitor, and no competitor may directly or indirectly obtain (by any means) the same from another competitor.
22.2.7 The Design Specifications for OSC and PDC will be made available to all Competitors for use as contemplated by these Technical Regulations by placing them on a server specified by the FIA. In accordance with the server terms and conditions, a Competitor who accesses and uses such Design Specifications will disclaim, waive and release any claims for loss or damages arising from such access and use to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law. The server terms and conditions may be found in Appendix 5.
22.2.8 Where a Competitor is made responsible under these Technical Regulations for raising any issues of safety, incompatibility and/or reliability of a component that it uses on its car, it shall not make any claim against any other party that is inconsistent with that responsibility.
22.2.9 Competitors may make available to other Competitors test facilities and equipment such as (but not limited to) wind tunnels or dynamometers. The Intellectual Property involved in the operation of such shared facilities may be used by and/or disclosed to the sharing party but the results of any experimental or test work carried out on such facilities may only be used by the originator of the work. Where facilities are shared, robust processes must be put in place to ensure there is no transfer of Intellectual Property through common personnel and that all data can only be accessed by the originator of the work. Any such sharing of facilities must be declared to the FIA with a full description of the work that will be carried out, and also of the processes that will be put in place in order to avoid an exchange of information that could lead to the transfer of knowledge leading to the performance enhancement of an LTC (as required by Article 22.3.4), a PDC (as required by Article 22.5.8), a TRC or FSC (as required by Article 22.6.8) of an OSC (as required by Article 22.7.10).
"
483,T,2021,22.3 Listed Team Components (LTC),"
22.3.1 “Listed Team Components” (LTC) are components whose design, manufacture and Intellectual Property is owned and/or controlled by a single Competitor or its agents on an exclusive basis (including, without limitation, the components identified as such in Article 22.8).
22.3.2 A Competitor may only use LTC in its Formula One cars that it has designed (including, for the avoidance of doubt, its three-dimensional shape and the evolution history leading to it, any preliminary designs, simulations, wind tunnel tests, and analysis) and manufactured itself. However, this does not prevent the Competitor Outsourcing any R&D, engineering and/or CAD design, and/or the manufacture of any LTC to a third party (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Associate of such Competitor) provided that:
a. the Competitor retains the exclusive right to use the LTC in Formula One for so long as it competes in Formula One;
b. the third party to whom manufacture of the LTC is Outsourced may not be another Competitor or an Associate to another Competitor; and
c. the third party to whom design of the LTC is Outsourced may not be another Competitor, an Associate to another Competitor, or a party that directly or indirectly designs LTCs or TRCs for any other Competitor.
22.3.3 Although it is permissible to be influenced by the design or concept of a Competitor's LTC using information that must potentially be available to all Competitors, this information may only be obtained at Events or Tests (as defined respectively in Articles 5 and 10.5 of the Sporting Regulations), and no Competitor may design its LTCs based on “reverse engineering” of another Competitor's LTC (or parts that were classified as “Listed Parts” under Appendix 6 of the 2019 or 2020 Sporting Regulations). For the purpose of this Article, “reverse engineering” shall mean:
a.
b. c. d.
The use of photographs or images, combined with software that converts them to point clouds, curves, surfaces, or allows CAD geometry to be overlaid onto or extracted from the photograph or image
The use of stereophotogrammetry, 3D cameras or any 3D stereoscopic techniques
Any form of contact or non-contact surface scanning
Any technique that projects points or curves on a surface so as to facilitate the reverse-engineering process
In cases where isolated features of a Competitor's LTC(s) may closely resemble the features of another Competitor's LTC(s), it will be the role of the FIA to determine whether this resemblance is the result of reverse engineering or of legitimate independent work. The following further provisions apply:
e. f.
g.
All Competitors must provide to the FIA, upon request, any data or other information that is required to demonstrate compliance with this Article.
For all LTCs used during the 2021 Championship, the restrictions described in this Article apply to their entire design process, including actions carried out before the 2021 calendar year.
For the purposes of assessing compliance with Article 22.3, and with Article 6.3 of the Sporting Regulations, any LTC classified as a 'Listed Part' under Appendix 6 of the 2019 or 2020 Sporting Regulations that was used by a Competitor during an Event of the 2019 Championship or during the first completed Event of the 2020 Championship will be deemed to have been designed by the Competitor and not be based on reverse engineering, irrespective of its origin, and the Competitor may therefore use this LTC, or develop it further, subject to such developments complying with the requirements of this Article.
h. The FIA may issue guidance from time to time to define more specifically the requirements and constraints of this Article.
22.3.4 No Competitor may, either directly or via a third party:
a. pass on any information in respect of its LTC (including but not limited to data, designs, drawings, or any other Intellectual Property) to another Competitor or receive any information from another Competitor in respect of that Competitor’s LTC; or
b. receive consultancy or any other kind of services from another Competitor in relation to LTC, or supply any such services to another Competitor; or
c. pass any methodology which can be used to enhance the performance of LTC (including but not limited to simulation software, analysis tools, etc.) to another Competitor, or receive any such methodology from another Competitor.
22.3.5 A Competitor (or its agents) must have exclusive ownership of (or the Competitor must have the exclusive right to use in the Championship) any and all rights, information or data of any nature (including but not limited to all aspects of the design, manufacturing, know-how, operating procedures, properties and calibrations) in respect of the LTC in its Formula One cars. However, notwithstanding the foregoing:
a. the use of specialist Intellectual Property or technology of third parties is permitted in respect of LTC, provided that this Intellectual Property or technology is commercially available to all Competitors. The principal parameters of such components must in any case be determined by the Competitor and not be available to other Competitors;
b. Similarly, it is permitted to use commercially available sub-components or sub- assemblies in respect of LTC, provided these are commercially available to all Competitors. This provision applies if these components or sub-assemblies are not specifically listed as LTC. The FIA may request Competitors to provide a list of such sub-components and their technical specification. The FIA may classify such sub- components or sub-assemblies as LTC if it deems that they are being contrived to circumvent the purpose of this Article 22.

484,T,2021,22.4 Standard Supply Components (SSC),"
22.4.1 “Standard Supply Components” (SSC) are components whose design and manufacture will be carried out by a supplier appointed by the FIA, to be supplied on an identical technical and commercial basis to each Competitor (including, without limitation, the components identified as such in Article 22.8).
22.4.2 Should a selection process fail to lead to appointment of a supplier of a component classified as a SSC, or should the arrangement with such supplier be terminated for whatever reason, the FIA reserves the right to re-classify the SSC as an LTC, PDC, TRC, or OSC and to introduce appropriate technical rules in the relevant Article of these Technical Regulations in order to control the technical specification and cost of this component.
22.4.3 Components supplied as SSC must not be modified, and they must be installed and operated exactly as specified by the supplier. However, each Competitor is responsible for communicating directly to the relevant SSC supplier, while keeping the FIA informed at all times, regarding any issues of compatibility, reliability or safety in respect of a SSC. This may include submitting proposals for modifications to the SSC that a Competitor considers should be made to ensure the necessary levels of safety, compatibility and reliability while at all times having due regard to cost and performance implications. In consultation with the relevant SSC supplier, the FIA will consider in good faith all issues raised (and modifications proposed) during the consultation process, and shall determine in its sole discretion whether or not to take any action. In exceptional circumstances, where a Competitor establishes that a SSC is critically incompatible, unreliable or unsafe, the FIA may, at its sole discretion, authorise such Competitor to carry out modifications to the SSC in question or use an alternative component in order to resolve the compatibility, reliability or safety issue. Permission for such a modification or usage of an alternative component will be
communicated to all Competitors, and will continue to be applied until the relevant supplier introduces a new specification that resolves the reliability, compatibility or safety concern.
22.4.4 The use of a SSC is mandatory and the particular function of that SSC must not be by-passed, replaced, duplicated or complemented by another component.
22.4.5 No Competitor may, either directly or via a third party pass any information (including but not limited to data, know how, operating procedures, properties and calibrations) or methodology (including but not limited to simulation software, analysis tools, etc.) which can be used to enhance the performance of a SSC to another Competitor, or receive any such methodology from another Competitor.
"
485,T,2021,22.5 Prescribed Design Components (PDC),"
22.5.1 “Prescribed Design Components” (PDC) are components whose Design Specification will be provided by the FIA (including, without limitation, the components identified as such in Article 22.8). Such components can be manufactured by a Competitor, its agent, or an external supplier on behalf of the Competitor, and these components can be supplied from one Competitor to another Competitor.
22.5.2 Where any Design Specification of a PDC or any PDC manufactured to a Design Specification is based on or comprises Intellectual Property contributed by a Competitor, all such Intellectual Property shall remain the exclusive property of that Competitor (or, where applicable, the third party from whom its right to use the relevant Intellectual Property has derived) and that Competitor grants an irrevocable, royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide licence to the other Competitors, their agents and external suppliers to use such Intellectual Property to the extent contemplated by these Technical Regulations. A Competitor, and/or their agents and external suppliers (as relevant), may only exercise its rights under such licence subject to it agreeing to be bound by the terms of the terms and conditions applicable to the FIA's designated server.
22.5.3 Should there be a failure in the design process of a PDC (including, but not limited to any relevant research and development or testing required to prove its functionality), the FIA reserves the right to re-classify the PDC as an LTC, TRC, or OSC and to introduce appropriate technical rules in the relevant Article of these Technical Regulations in order to control the technical specification and cost of this component.
22.5.4 PDC’s must not be modified, and they must be installed and operated exactly as specified by the FIA, with the exception of specific modifications that may be permitted by the relevant Article of the Technical Regulations.
22.5.5 The FIA will consult with all Competitors in respect of the compatibility, reliability and safety of each PDC: (i) during the design phase of a PDC (i.e., before the FIA makes any determination on the Design Specification of that PDC); and (ii) again during the implementation phase (i.e. during the manufacture, installation and testing) of a PDC.
22.5.6 During the consultation process set out in Article 22.5.5, each Competitor is responsible for communicating directly to the FIA regarding any issues of compatibility, reliability or safety in respect of a PDC. This may include submitting proposals for modifications to the PDC that a Competitor considers should be made to ensure the necessary levels of safety, compatibility, and reliability while having due regard at all times to cost and performance implications. The FIA will consider in good faith all issues raised (and modifications proposed) during the consultation process, and shall determine in its sole discretion whether or not to take any action. In exceptional circumstances, where a Competitor establishes at any time that a PDC is critically incompatible, unreliable or unsafe, the FIA may, at its sole discretion, authorise such Competitor to carry out modifications to the PDC in question in order to resolve the compatibility, reliability or safety issue. Permission for such a modification will be communicated to all Competitors, and will continue to be applied until the FIA introduces a new Design Specification that resolves the reliability, compatibility or safety concern.
22.5.7 The use of a PDC is mandatory and the particular function of that PDC must not be by-passed, replaced, duplicated or complemented by another component.
22.5.8 No Competitor may, either directly or via a third party pass any information (including but not limited to data, know how, operating procedures, properties and calibrations) or methodology (including but not limited to simulation software, analysis tools, etc.) which can be used to enhance the performance of a PDC to another Competitor, or receive any such information or methodology from another Competitor.

Under no circumstances is it permitted for the Supplying Competitor to carry out the design or manufacture of bespoke TRC’s for the specific use by a Customer Competitor. The Customer Competitor may however elect to replace or modify sub components of a TRC or FSC, but in that case all the related additional work (including, but not limited to Research and Development, simulations, design, manufacture etc.) must be carried out by the Customer Competitor or its agents. In exceptional circumstances, and with the prior approval of the FIA, the Supplying Competitor may provide assistance to the Customer Competitor for the resolution of reliability or safety issues regarding the TRC or FSC.
"
490,T,2021,22.6 Transferable Components (TRC) and Free Supply Components (FSC),"22.6.5 The Supplying Competitor may outsource the design (intended for this Article as any R&D, Engineering and CAD design) and/or manufacture of any TRC of FSC to a third party (including, for the avoidance of doubt, an Associate of such Competitor) provided that:
a. the third party to whom manufacture of the TRC or FSC is Outsourced may not be another Competitor; and
b. the third party to whom design of the TRC or FSC is Outsourced may not be another Competitor, or a party that directly or indirectly designs TRCs, FSCs or LTCs for any other Competitor.
"
491,T,2021,22.6 Transferable Components (TRC) and Free Supply Components (FSC),"22.6.6 The Supplying Competitor (or its agents) must have exclusive ownership of and/or control over any and all rights, information or data of any nature (including but not limited to all aspects of the design, manufacturing, know-how, operating procedures, properties and calibrations) in respect of the TRC or FSC in its Formula One cars. However, notwithstanding the foregoing:
a. the use of specialist Intellectual Property or technology of third parties is permitted in respect of TRCs or FSCs, provided that this Intellectual Property or technology is commercially available to all Competitors. The principal parameters of such components must in any case be determined by the Competitor and not be available to other Competitors.
b. similarly, it is permitted to use commercially available sub-components or sub- assemblies in respect of TRCs or FSCs, provided these are commercially available to all Competitors.
"
492,T,2021,22.6 Transferable Components (TRC) and Free Supply Components (FSC),"22.6.7 A third party unrelated to any Competitor may supply a TRC or FSC to a Customer Competitor, provided that it also offers to supply the TRC or FSC to any other Customer Competitor on similar commercial terms.
"
493,T,2021,22.6 Transferable Components (TRC) and Free Supply Components (FSC),"22.6.8 In respect of the conditions at Article 22.3.4, any information on TRC passed on or received by a Competitor or any consultancy or any other kind of services involving a Competitor in relation to TRC or FSC shall be strictly limited to the designs or drawings necessary for the integration of the TRC or FSC into the design of the car and/or the data of the TRC or FSC necessary for the correct operation of the TRC or FSC on the car.

22.7.1 “Open Source Components” (OSC) are components whose Design Specification and Intellectual Property is made available to all Competitors through the mechanisms defined in this Article 22.7 (including, without limitation, the components identified as such in Article 22.8).
"
495,T,2021,22.7 Open Source Components (OSC),"22.7.2 For all OSC in use by all Competitors, the Design Specification must reside on a designated server specified by the FIA, and be accessible by all Competitors. Details about the server, access credentials and file naming and format conventions may be found in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations.
"
496,T,2021,22.7 Open Source Components (OSC),"22.7.3 Any Competitor who designs a new OSC or modifies the Design Specification of a previous OSC must upload the new Design Specification to the designated server before the first track usage of this OSC in either a Competition or a test.
"
497,T,2021,22.7 Open Source Components (OSC),"22.7.4 Any Competitor who creates a new, or modifies an existing, Design Specification of an OSC or any OSC manufactured to a Design Specification grants an irrevocable, royalty-free, non- exclusive, worldwide licence to all other Competitors to use and modify any of its Intellectual Property subsisting in such OSCs or Design Specifications to the extent contemplated by these Technical Regulations. A Competitor may only exercise its rights under such licence subject to it agreeing to be bound by the terms of the terms and conditions applicable to the FIA's designated server.
"
498,T,2021,22.7 Open Source Components (OSC),"22.7.5 In the event the OSC or the Design Specification of any OSC contains proprietary information and/or Intellectual Property of a third party supplier, this must be made clear by the Competitor when uploading the Design Specification of the OSC, and use of the uploaded Design Specification (and any OSC manufactured to that Design Specification) by any other Competitor exercising its rights in accordance with these Technical Regulations must be approved in writing by the third party supplier, with a copy of such approval to be available to the FIA on request. Should it become necessary to remove any sensitive information, then the uploaded Design Specification must:
a. Contain a clear reference to the supplier in question.
b. Contain sufficient information for another Competitor to be able to order an identical component from the supplier.
c. Contain all the necessary information to permit another Competitor to install the OSC in their own car.
"
499,T,2021,22.7 Open Source Components (OSC),"22.7.6 All Competitors are obliged to declare to the FIA the version of each OSC that gets used on their car. This information will be made available to all Competitors.
"
500,T,2021,22.7 Open Source Components (OSC),"22.7.7 The complete responsibility for the installation and operation of an OSC (including any matters related to its function, performance, reliability, compatibility or safety) resides with
the Competitor who uses this version of the OSC. Notwithstanding this provision, any Competitor who encounters a functionality, reliability, compatibility or safety issue with a particular version of an OSC is obliged to provide such information to the FIA and all other Competitors via the designated server.
"
501,T,2021,22.7 Open Source Components (OSC),"22.7.8 OSC’s may be provided from one Competitor to another, provided that the specification supplied from the Supplying Competitor to the Customer Competitor is of the same specification utilized by the Supplying Competitor.
"
502,T,2021,22.7 Open Source Components (OSC),"22.7.9 For any component designated as OSC for 2022, Competitors must upload the design of the equivalent component in use during the 2021 Championship, no later than 15 July 2021, regardless of the suitability of this component to the 2022 Technical Regulations.

503,T,2021,22.7 Open Source Components (OSC),"22.7.10 No Competitor may, either directly or via a third party pass any information (including but not limited to data, know how, operating procedures, properties and calibrations) or methodology (including but not limited to simulation software, analysis tools, etc.) which can be used to enhance the performance of an OSC to another Competitor, or receive any such information or methodology from another Competitor.
"
504,T,2021,22.8 Homologated Components (HC) for 2021,"
22.8.1 In order to significantly reduce the design, R&D and components costs for 2020 and 2021, a number of components or assemblies will be homologated for the 2021 Championship. Such components or assemblies will be known as “Homologated Components” (HC) and will be referred to with the suffix “-H” following their main classification (e.g. “LTC-H”, “TRC-H”).
"
505,T,2021,22.8 Homologated Components (HC) for 2021,"22.8.2 The specification of HC during the 2021 Championship will be determined by their specification in one of three possible freeze dates:
a. The earliest date between the date of P1 of the first Competition of the 2020 Championship, or 1 September 2020. This date is denoted as “R1-2020” for the purposes of this Article.
b. 30 September 2020. This date is denoted as “mid-2020” for the purposes of this Article.
c. The date of P1 of the first Competition of the 2021 Championship. This date is denoted as “R1-2021” for the purposes of this Article.
"
506,T,2021,22.8 Homologated Components (HC) for 2021,"22.8.3 From the defined freeze date, only a single specification of any assembly, system, or component classified as HC may be used during the 2021 Championship, and this specification may not change, save for the following exceptions:
a. Minimal changes for safety, reliability or cost reasons.
b. Changes for driver comfort, or for the installation of a new driver. For the avoidance of doubt, changes which are intended to improve the functionality of the driver will not be accepted (e.g. new switch layout to increase the number of available options).
c. Changes of supplier, if the existing HC supplier is unable to continue the supply of a component or sub-assembly. In such cases, the specification of the new component or sub-assembly must be as close as possible to that of the component or sub- assembly it replaces.
d. Changes due to regulation changes, legality fixes or the installation of FIA-mandated components.
e. Minimal setup options of parts of the HC. Such options may include, but are not limited to washers, spacers, spring stiffness, brackets, etc. In any case the FIA must be satisfied that these setup options do not constitute a fundamentally new design or specification of the HC.
f. Minimal modifications that can be applied onto a finished HC of the original design specification. Such modifications may include, but are not limited to, minor local machining, the drilling of a hole, or minor local reinforcement, which in the opinion of the FIA do not have a significant cost or functionality implication.
In such cases, the modified HC must have no performance or weight improvement in comparison to the component or assembly it replaces.
In all cases, the Competitor must seek the approval of the FIA with full details of the planned modification. The FIA must be fully satisfied that the reasons of the suggested modification are the ones claimed by the Competitor, and that such modifications are consistent with the intent of this Article, before granting their permission for the suggested modifications. In any case, feedback by the FIA will be given within 7 days from receiving the request from the team.
In the event the Competitor wishes to sign-off modifications carried out under the provisions of this Article, the Competitor must seek the approval of the FIA for the sign-off process, which must be restricted to free practice sessions during a Competition. The Competitor may then elect to confirm the modification for subsequent use.
More than one specification of the HC may be used if explicitly allowed by the table in Appendix 4. For short periods of time, and with the approval of the FIA, an older specification of the HC may be used as a spare should the new specification not be available in sufficient numbers for manufacturing reasons.
"
507,T,2021,22.8 Homologated Components (HC) for 2021,"22.8.4 Notwithstanding the objectives and provisions of this Article 22.8, Competitors may use up to a total of two (2) tokens for the modification of certain homologated components after the specified freeze date. This provision applies only for HCs with R1-2020 or mid-2020 freeze dates. For the avoidance of doubt, if one or two tokens have been used during the 2020 Championship, as allowed under Article 22.1.4 of the 2020 Technical Regulations, the updated components of the 2020 Championship must continue to be used for the 2021 Championship, and these tokens will be considered as used also for 2021.
In order to use this provision, the Competitor must observe the following timeframe in relation to notifying the FIA:
- D1: notify the FIA of the intent to modify an HC, with an estimate on the parts it affects and a brief description of the reasons
- D2: provide the FIA with a full specification of the intended changes of the HC and any affected components
- D3: provide the FIA with a detailed scheme of the intended changes
For all three deadlines, the FIA will undertake to respond to the Competitor within a week in relation to the proposed modification.
The following table shows the deadlines of these three dates in accordance to the HC that is getting modified:
b. Following a declaration within the set time scales, should the Competitor wish to abandon the related project, it will not be possible to re-use the tokens for other purposes.
c. In the case an HC component has been revised either through the use of tokens, or before its homologation date but does not meet the Competitors expectations, it will be permitted to revert back to the original specification of this HC component within five Competitions from its first introduction. Any tokens used may not be re-used for other purposes, and the new specification must be discarded.
"
508,T,2021,22.8 Homologated Components (HC) for 2021,"22.8.5 In the event a Customer Competitor buys a TRC-H or FSC-H from a Supplying Competitor, the following provisions apply:
a. Any tokens used by the Supplying Competitor for modifications to that TRC-H or FSC- H will also apply to the Customer Competitor, should the Customer Competitor decide to use the updated component. In any case, the Supplying Competitor should use their best endeavours to ensure that such an update (and use of tokens) is not mandatory for the Customer Competitor.
b. In the event the Customer Competitor has used for that TRC-H or FSC-H the 2019 specification of the Supplying Competitor during the 2020 season, but wishes to upgrade to the 2020 specification for the 2021 season, this change will be acceptable without the use of any tokens.
"
509,T,2021,22.8 Homologated Components (HC) for 2021,"22.8.6 In the event a Competitor wishes to carry out a completely new Power Unit installation (whether because of a new Power Unit Architecture, or because of the change of Power Unit supplier), affecting both the survival cell and the gearbox, no further tokens may be used for other components under the provisions of Article 22.8.4.
In such cases, the Competitor must satisfy the FIA that the proposed changes to the design of the affected HCs are the minimum necessary to allow for the new installation of the Power Unit. No further changes to the affected HCs may be carried out, nor may the adopted technology be different from the original HCs.
In order to fulfil this requirement, the Competitor must organise with the FIA a schedule of regular CAD design reviews, in such way that should the FIA have a concern about the proposed extent of the modifications, a remedial action can be decided in a timely manner.
"
510,T,2021,22.8 Homologated Components (HC) for 2021,"22.8.7 The FIA will communicate to the Competitors the exact procedure though which it will verify compliance with the provisions of Article 22.8 for all components designated as HCs.
"
511,T,2021,"22.9 Classification, homologation and perimeter of each group","
A complete list of the parts’ classification and homologation status, freeze date and tokens, as well as a definition of the perimeter of each assembly can be found in Appendix 4.
Components which are part of an assembly will assume the classification status of that assembly unless otherwise specified.
